The Vanquishers of the Nine Hordes long parted ways but life in Aventuria went on. Cassia, a young woman of noble descent, has only one goal: She wants to claim the Shark Throne, no matter the price; and be it only for one day. Unfortunately, there are two problems that potentially foil her plans. First of all, she spends her days incarcerated in a dungeon and secondly, there is already a man on her throne: Marwan. She is neither fond nor proficient in matters of diplomacy or politics, so she chooses a more... practical approach. She intends to break out of prison and overthrow Marwan to claim the throne herself. For this, she needs strong allies. She needs to recruit an army of Sellswords and rally the Vanquishers of the Nine Hordes around her. Sounds like a solid plan, doesn't it? But then again, how cunning must one be to escape the dungeon's walls; and how reckless must one be to gather and command the worst scum of the realms?<br><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/314830/extras/BG2_Steam_Features.png?t=1478164040"" ><br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""> <li>Recruit mercenaries, find upgrades and build an indomitable army<br></li><li>Find the Vanquishers of the Nine Hordes and see what has become of Takate, Naurim and Zurbaran<br></li><li>A story with many twists and turns, fateful decisions and more than 20 challenging hours of playtime awaits you<br></li><li>Command up to 20 characters in your party and lead them to death or glory<br></li><li>Master and finish the game on many different non-linear paths<br></li><li>Make decisions influencing your squad and the ending of the game<br></li><li>Choose your spells, talents and skills wisely, since they dictate your strategy on the battlefield.

If you press Kick on the ground, you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves, the first hit will win the round, and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game.

The full stories are still there – on the menu page and somewhere within the game… if you know where to look!!<br><br>Find the twelve orphan’s mementos and place them on the correct headstones to set the lost souls free. Did we mention the headstones are in a hedge maze? Custom-created by a ‘Ripley’s Believe-It-Or-Not’ Maze Master? No problem! But first you’ll have to find the key... Are you up to the challenge? Did we mention the Huntsman… in the maze… stalking you? Did we mention he may also be lurking in Grimhaven Orphanage? <br><br>So – how fast can you turn and run? Well you won’t know ‘till you check it out! So go do it! Have fun!!

87530984-e50c-45e9-b884-9142355f758a,"Kingdom: New Lands","<h1>Royal Edition</h1><p>The Royal Edition includes the original Kingdom soundtrack plus 9 brand new tracks for New Lands, composed once again by the talented ToyTree.</p><br><h1>Why add Kingdom: New Lands – you say?</h1><p>Well, it’s an expanded and much improved-on version of the indie hit and IGF nominated Kingdom, originally designed and developed by Noio and Licorice – two awesome independent developers. The game came out on PC late last year and has provided hundreds of thousands of people with a solid way to spend some time in a faraway fantasy land, exploring, discovering and surviving. So, you know… a fun game!</p><br><h1>What is the game about?</h1><p>Good question! One approach to it would we to try to compile some sort of feature list, but what does that really tell you. Another way to address this question is to talk about the emotional journey and experience that Kingdom: New Lands offers.<br><br>It is about exploration, discovery, survival and that awesome feeling that you get, when you figure something out, on your own. When multiple pieces all of a sudden come together to form a whole – a basis for a new strategy or an understanding how something in the world of Kingdom: New Lands truly works.<br><br>It is about tenacity and overcoming obstacles – even when they seem to be unsurmountable. Pulling through, against all odds. Rebuilding and recovering. And that huge internal high-five when you succeed. <br><br>It is about figuring out how best to manage your little Kingdom and tie everything together in a fashion where the game doesn’t play you – you play the game.<br><br>It’s also beautiful, tranquil, melancholy, frantic, stressful and wonderful. It delivers a spectrum of emotions that combine into a unique experience.<br><br>It's a minimalist strategy game where you need to discover the rules of how the world behaves before you can rule effectively. It's also a little bit whimsical, it's pretty, and it can be frustrating but it won't hold your hand.</p><br><h1>But what’s new?</h1><p>Kingdom: New Lands introduces a lot of new things and builds on the original Kingdom game. It changes the end game significantly. It’s loaded with new elements, new things to discover and explore. It meets a lot of requests for new features, suggested improvements and general feedback from the incredible and wonderful community that has embraced the world of Kingdom and stuck with the game since the launch of the original title – and even further back, when the earliest iteration of Kingdom was a Flash based browser game, enjoyed by an incredible number of people.<br><br>So, for anyone that has played Kingdom before, Kingdom: New Lands will introduce many new elements that revitalize the experience. New players will find a bigger, deeper world than the original Kingdom (now called Kingdom: Classic) had to offer.<br><br>We hope you try out the game and enjoy playing it, as much as we’ve enjoyed getting it into your hands.</p><br><h1>Относно играта</h1><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/496300/extras/sticker_archer_shooting-cropped.png?t=1525287423"" ><br>Tales spread of far off isles with mysteries waiting to be discovered. Rulers will need all the strength of their subjects to sail away and find new kingdoms in these New Lands.<br><br>Kingdom: New Lands builds upon the award-winning gameplay and mystery of Kingdom by introducing an abundance of new content to the IGF-nominated title while maintaining the simplicity and depth that legions of monarchs have come to experience and enjoy.

Players will relive the events of ‘Operation Market Garden’ across the fields and towns of Holland. This massive Allied assault consisted of a coordination of the British and American Airborne to capture key bridges while the British XXXth Corps moved to reinforce them through Highway 69. However, consecutive delays in consolidating ground from the north of Belgium through Nijmegen forced the 1st British Airborne Division in Arnhem to make a stand much longer than anticipated. With no successful link between the XXXth Corps and the Airborne in sight, the seventh and final bridge in Arnhem was considered lost.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/736220/extras/Vehicles_PS.png?t=1529489117"" ><br><br>‘The Bloody Seventh’ is our name for the initial focus of the project as we feel it succinctly details the struggle that the British paratroopers had to endure while waiting for their army counterpart to establish a link through the lower Rhine.<br><br>Players will be given the option to fight with the British Airborne Division, British XXX Corps or several branches of the German Army, such as the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. It’s a rare opportunity to experience the intense battlefield that was the Battle of Arnhem, which stretched across farms, woods, villages and city areas. Each area is being accurately recreated from archival references that range from street level to aerial images. Whether you’re jumping out of a plane, resupplying friendlies or operating a tank you will find multiple reasons to drop back into the battlefield in this grand scaled representation of a WW2 setting never explored in a large multiplayer environment."

The key to success lies in good planning by season, expert knowledge that you acquire throughout the game, and skill and good old-fashioned hard work. As a farmer, the player learns to live with the forces of nature, accept the weather and respond so as to perfect the yield from fields, care for the animals and prepare the budget for new investments. Many tractors and farm machines (combine harvesters, field choppers, attaching parts and trailers, etc.) by renowned manufacturers are available to cultivate the farm and manage all the work.  Only good planning and hard work will turn fallow earth into a flourishing and fertile soil. Of course, you can drive and control all machines yourself, be it hooking up the plough, re-filling the tractor or unloading the harvest.<br><br>&quot;Professional Farmer 2014&quot; has a broad variety of crops, depending on the environment and climate, with which the farmer can cultivate the fields diversely, effectively and with a high yield.

After just a short time, you should take our home grown and harvested produce to the market and earn your first money by selling it.

This gives the multiplayer game more depth than ever before, as individual matches now matter for the overall victory or loss in the MP campaign. Both sides battle it out to control territories on a large scale battle map, voting on which territories to attack, whether to attempt to take more territory, or to defend and try to grind down the enemy's resources. We like to say it is like a “meta-game&quot; of Risk. This features both Stalingrad and Pacific Theater campaigns. <br></li><li>All new level: Betio. The tiny island of Betio was the scene of the heaviest fighting during the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943, the first major US amphibious offensive of the Pacific Theater. The map here recreates the push of the US 2nd Marine Division across the devastated island against their counterparts in the 6th Special Naval Landing Force (the Japanese 'Marines') as the US forces attempt to disable key tactical objectives such as naval guns and transmitter stations. The map favors desperate pitched defenses and assaults at all costs. <br></li><li>Two new weapons, one for Rising Storm and one for Red Orchestra 2. Red Orchestra 2 gets the PPS-42 submachine gun. Born out of desperation during the siege of Leningrad, the PPS-42 provides the Russians with a powerful, lightweight SMG option. For Rising Storm, the Japanese get the Type 97 sniper rifle. More accurate than the existing Type 99 sniper rifle, this weapon gives the Japanese another way to reach out and touch their enemies. <br></li><li>Classic Mode Refinements. While Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2 are considered by many to be one of the most hardcore shooters out there, the hardcore among the fan base have been clamoring for something even more extreme and authentic. The fans have asked and we've answered with further refinements to Classic Mode (the most hardcore gameplay mode in RS/RO2). We've made player movement changes, as well as aiming and recoil changes to make it more difficult to keep your aim on enemies resulting in longer and more intense firefights. </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Previous Updates:</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Counterattack Map Contest Pack 1: 4 new maps!<br></li><li>Counterattack Map Contest Pack 2: 3 new maps!</li></ul></p><br><h1>Digital Deluxe Edition</h1><p><img src=""http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/234510/extras/game_page_banner_tweaked.jpg"" ><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Day 1 Unlock of: the US M12 Trench shotgun, the Japanese Type 99 Machine Gun, the Japanese Type 99 Sniper Rifle with 4X scope (level 2), and the US M1 Garand with bayonet (Level 2).<br></li><li>2 Rising Storm soldier playable characters for Killing Floor. <br></li><li>Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2 soundtracks.<br></li><li>Will include the Red Orchestra 2 Steam Digital Deluxe Edition Upgrade (4 day 1 unlock weapons, 2 playable RO2 KF characters, and 2 RO2 hats in TF2).</li></ul></p><br><h1>Относно играта</h1><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>INCLUDES ALL RED ORCHESTRA 2 MULTIPLAYER CONTENT!</strong></h2><br>Rising Storm is the next game in the award-winning Red Orchestra franchise.

Players will experience beach assaults, jungle fighting, close quarters night fighting and more across Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and Saipan, among other iconic battles. The player is able to take the part of either side – American or Japanese – battling it out online in multiplayer on up to 64-player servers.<br><br>Rising Storm also introduces an entirely new type of gameplay to the franchise - asymmetrical warfare. The American’s have the apparent advantage in firepower with their fast firing semi-automatic rifles, fully automatic weapons, and devastating flamethrower. The Japanese balance this out with gameplay elements that model their raw courage, ferocity, and cunning use of equipment. Their knee mortars allow them to rain indirect fire down on their enemies from anywhere in the map. Grenades can be planted and turned into booby-traps for unwary GIs. The Japanese put very high store on close-quarter combat, with a bayonet on almost every weapon – even machine guns and SMGs. Their banzai charge suppresses the enemy making it difficult for them to return fire and gives them an opportunity to close in to use bayonets and katanas on their opponents.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>	Large Scale Multiplayer Combat in The Pacific: Take part in the brutal fighting in the Pacific online with up to 64 players at a time.<br></li><li>	Iconic Battles:  Experience iconic battles such as Iwo Jima, Saipan, and Guadalcanal as the US military struggles to clear the Japanese from the islands in the Pacific.<br></li><li>	Asymmetrical Gameplay: Far from the mirrored gameplay seen in other shooters, both sides utilize historical weapon sets and each have unique gameplay capabilities. American firepower is matched by Japanese ferocity and guile with such features as banzai charges, booby-traps, the infamous “knee mortar” and more. This creates a unique gameplay experience that can’t be found anywhere else. <br></li><li>	WWII weaponry redefined – again: all of the weapon functionality you expect from the franchise returns - true to life ballistics, bullet penetration, breathing, adjustable sights, free aim, weapon bracing, and more, create WWII weaponry that has no equal. To that add over 20 new weapons including the devastating flamethrower and the portable “knee mortar”.<br></li><li>	Morale: Your soldier’s state of mind plays a bigger role than ever. Banzai charging Japanese soldiers can heavily suppress the Americans making it difficult to return fire and allowing the Japanese to close the distance.  The Americans can use their firepower advantage to suppress their enemies and gain the advantage!<br></li><li>	Bonus Content: All Red Orchestra 2 multiplayer content is included with Rising Storm as a free bonus.

Now surviving as a reclusive mercenary on the edge of a corrupted world, the formidable warrior must again wield a devastating combination of guns, blades, magic and wit to strike down the demonic legions overwhelming the world. Battle alongside allies online in four-player co-op or go it alone in spectacular procedurally-generated landscapes to complete daring missions and collect powerful new weapons, armor, and arcane relics of legend.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">STORY</h2>Five years have passed since Lo Wang shattered the alliance between his deceitful former boss and the ancient gods of the shadow realm. Despite noble intentions, Lo Wang’s efforts to annihilate the darkness corrupted the world, creating a strange and savage new order where humans and demons live side by side. <br><br>The once feared warrior now lives in the shifting wildlands outside the reach of his enemies and the neon glow of Zilla’s cybernetic metropolis, scratching out a meager existence as a hired sword for the local Yakuza clans. When a simple mission goes wrong, Lo Wang is drawn into a volatile conflict between a brilliant young scientist, his nemesis Orochi Zilla, and the demonic forces that have become unsettled in our world. The sharp-tongued hero must once again wield lethal blades, staggering firepower, and archaic magic to purge the world of evil.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">FEATURES</h2><br><strong>Blades and Bullets:</strong> Lo Wang delivers his own brand full throttle brutality with an expanded array of over 70 lethal blades and explosive firearms to overcome the demonic opposition.

Tackle challenging primary missions or thrilling side quests while maintaining your own ninja style with customizable armor, items, and valuable loot from your triumphs.<br><br><strong>Procedural Environments:</strong> The breach between the human and demon realms created an interdimensional hernia resulting in constant shifts to the world of Shadow Warrior 2. Procedurally generated landscapes and paths bring new twists and turns to once familiar terrain and routine missions. <br><br><strong>Brutal Damage System:</strong> Choose your weapon based on the situation at hand and then dismantle everything that stands in your path with an advanced gore system.

Players build space ships, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored.<br><br>Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes.<br><br>Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity.<br><br>Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future.<br><br>Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build."

This new game puts players in command of detailed, historically accurate tanks, troops, and vehicles at the height of World War II.  Players can measure their tactical skills against several opponents in big multiplayer battles or against enemies in a challenging single-player campaign. Steel Division: Normandy 44  allows players to take control over legendary military divisions from six different countries, such as the American 101st Airborne, the German armored 21st Panzer or the 3rd Canadian Division, during the invasion of Normandy in 1944. <br><br><strong>Main Features:</strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Command Over 400 Historically Accurate Units:</h2> Whether fighting for control in intense multiplayer battles with up to 10-vs-10 players going head-to-head, playing alone or working with friends in ranked matches, players will need to coordinate their selection of historically accurate infantry, tanks, aircraft, and support vehicles to counter enemy units in this Tactical RTS game.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Real-world Tactics: </h2>Battles rage over three distinct phases, where different units unlock over time, mimicking the movements of real-world armies and adding variety to the ever-changing theatre of war. A dynamic front line illustrates the ebb and flow of the conflict.  Pin down your opponent's infantry to gain the advantage and force a retreat, or push through with a perfectly executed plan.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Real-world Setting:</h2>Using the latest version of Eugen’s IRISZOOM engine, players can smoothly zoom from a tactical aerial view all the way down to a single unit, and see 400 different real-world vehicles and units designed with careful historical detail and accuracy. Maps are designed based on actual aerial reconnaissance photos of Normandy in 1944, requiring real-world tactics and strategies to cover and control.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Outplan, Outsmart, Outgun:</h2>From battlegroup customization to troop positioning and maneuvering, winning battles requires cunning and strategy, not just raw firepower. Each unit lost presents a growing tactical disadvantage, and players will need to fight to gain -- and keep -- the upper hand.<br><br>From commanding historically accurate infantry, tanks, and vehicles, to troop positioning and real-time engagement with the enemy, players will need to be clever and resourceful in order to win. Every unit counts as the battle presses on, and raw firepower alone will not be enough to claim victory. Whether viewing the entire battle from an aerial perspective, or following a single tank into a firefight, players will need to cleverly manage the dynamic front line in order to execute ambushes and advances."

Crusader 2 will recapture the original game’s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation.<br><br>True to its roots this new Stronghold will define old school real time strategy, combining RTS and city builder gameplay. Playing as a brutal Crusader Knight or Arabic freedom fighter, you must use a deadly array of troops and destructive siege equipment to decide the fate of the holy lands.

Once your skills have been perfected put them to the test in skirmish mode or take the battle online with up to eight human and AI players.

The peoples of these regions came collectively to be known as the Anglo Saxons.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/712100/extras/Alfred_The_Lad.jpg?t=1525361900"" ><br><br><strong>West Seaxe</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Alfred</strong><br><br>As the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom of southern England, the forces of West Seaxe – or Wessex in modern English – provided the isle’s primary resistance against the incursions of the Great Heathen Army. From the capital city of Winchester, Wessex conquered lands in Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex and even Mercia. Alfred’s dogged defense of the Danish invasion laid the foundations for Wessex to unite England under one ruler for the first time in 927 AD.<br><br><strong>Mierce</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Ceowulf</strong><br><br>From its capital city of Tamworth, the kings of Mierce – known now as Merica - ruled the area now known as the Midlands. At its height, Mierce stretched from Northumbria in the north of England to Kent, Sussex and Wessex to the south. In 877 AD, the Great Heathen Army seized the eastern part of the kingdom to form the Danelaw, or East Engle.<br><br><strong>The Gaels – Mide and Circenn</strong><br><br>Gaelic culture initially developed in Ireland, their society built around a system of clans and chieftains. They raided and traded with Roman settlements, and by 878 AD had expanded from Ireland to inhabit much of Scotland.<br>With the influx of the Vikings, some raiders settled in Gaelic lands, becoming the Norse-Gaels. The Scottish Gaels would absorb the Picts to become the Kingdom of Alba – essentially setting the blueprint for modern Scotland. <br><br><strong>Mide</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Flann Sinna</strong><br><br>Mide lies at the heart of Ireland. Not just geographically, but politically, intellectually and spiritually. Many High Kings have risen from Mide, and its current ruler, Flann Sinna, aspires to that title.<br><br>With many fellow Irish factions nearby, Mide is in a position to potentially bring the disparate clans together, and usher in an era of Irish prosperity. However, threats are never far away… the Vikings of Dyflin have settled to the east, and their power and influence are growing. Will Mide strive to keep the uneasy peace? Unite the clans in a war against these Norse settlers? Or find some other route to supremacy?  <br><br><strong>Circenn</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Áed mac Cináeda</strong><br><br>Circenn was in origin Pictish, but became more heavily influenced by the Gaels and other peoples over time as they were driven away from the relentless Viking raids. 878 AD marked the end of the Viking invasions, but Circenn’s troubles were far from over. While she had a firm hold over the eastern coast of Scotland, many threats still exist – both within and without.   <br><br>Scoan, the capital of Circenn, was once home to the legendary Stone of Destiny, said to bestow divine strength on her people. Where the stone now resides is a mystery, but if clues can be found, surely the Stone’s recovery would be an adventure worth undertaking…<br><br><strong>The Welsh – Gwined and Strat Clut</strong><br><br>The Welsh Kingdoms descended from the Celtic Britons who occupied much of the island of Britain from the Iron Age, into and beyond its Romanisation in the First Century. <br><br>Ironically, the term ‘Welsh’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon term for foreigner, ‘wealas’, which they applied to the native Britons. The Anglo-Saxons flourished and many of the old Brittonic kingdoms began to disappear. <br><br><strong>Gwined</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Anaraut</strong><br><br>The people of Gwined have some claim to the title of 'true Britons', having been driven to the far west by invaders who now call themselves ‘English’. Renowned both for their bardic arts and their skill with the longbow, the Welsh of Gwined thrived under the leadership of Rhodri Mawr. <br><br>Rhodri kept Gwined largely free of Vikings and other invaders while expanding its borders. Now he is gone and his lands are divided. <br><br><strong>Strat Clut</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Run</strong><br><br>Strat Clut is a kingdom of the Old North that can be traced back to the Fifth Century and the Celtic Britons. The realm was formerly based at the fortress of Alt Clut but driven out by a Viking invasion in 870. The current King Artgal was taken captive and reportedly killed in mysterious circumstances. The kingdom reformed further into the valley of the River Clyde under the leadership of his only son Run.<br><br><strong>The Great Viking Army – Northymbre and East Engle</strong><br><br>In 865 AD, Ragnar’s sons led the Great Viking Army and made landfall in East Anglia. Over the next 15 years the Vikings ranged high and low, from Wessex to The Clyde, conquering towns, claiming victories and suffering their share of defeats until the Battle of Edington in 878 AD, where its leader Guthrum met his match in the young King Alfred and his West Saxon army. Bested in the field, his forces retreated in disarray to a nearby fortress. Flush with success, Alfred’s men gave chase and laid siege. After a fortnight of starvation, the invaders surrendered.<br><br>Under the terms of his capitulation, Guthrum was baptised into Christianity and he and his men were allowed to return to East Anglia and settle – provided they kept Alfred’s peace, of course.<br>Defeated, but never humbled, the Vikings seethe with an all-consuming rage. One does not cage the wolf without consequence…<br><br><strong>Northymbre</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Guthfrid</strong><br><br>When the Vikings arrived in Northumbria in 867 AD, they took the city of York – or Eoferwic, as was – for their stronghold. And what a bastion it was, with its formidable Roman walls still standing strong 700 years on. King Aelle of Northumbria attempted to wrest the city back from the Danes, but was captured during the attack. In retribution for Aelle’s execution of their father, the sons of Ragnar made an example of him with the horrifying Blood Eagle ritual.<br><br>Northumbria remained under Viking control and, after the battle of Edington and the subsequent treaty of Wedmore, a portion of the Great Viking Army marched back to Northumbria, to settle under Alfred’s peace.<br><br><strong>East Engle</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Guthrum</strong><br><br>Forming the bulk of Britannia’s south-easterly coast, East Engle was the staging-point of the Great Viking Army’s invasion, and the region where many of its warriors settled after the Battle of Edington. Under the rule of the Danish leader Guthrum (or Æthelstan, to use his adoptive name by Alfred) it would ultimately come to be known as the Danelaw.<br>Yet still, some fight remains in the Danes of East Engle. One does not shed the mantle of glory and become a landsman overnight.<br><br><strong>The Viking Sea Kings – Dyflin and Sudreyar</strong><br><br>After nearly a century of escalating raids, the Vikings left an indelible stamp on Britannia, altering the course of its history forever. Not least of all culturally, as many smaller bands of Vikings had settled around the isles prior to Alfred’s defeat of the Great Viking army.<br>These smaller factions traded an existence of ceaseless conflict for a new life in Britannia, establishing their own petty principalities, intermarrying and ultimately becoming part of the warp-and-woof of Britannic life. This mingling of cultures, so emblematic of British history, helped create the rich melting-pot of attitudes, beliefs and language that has made the isles and their people so unique.<br><br>Some Vikings never truly settled however; their designs were grander, their hunger for conquest and greatness unquenched. These Sea Kings would continue their bellicose work, heedless of any decree from England’s upstart ruler…<br><br><strong>Dyflin</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Bardr</strong><br><br>Dyflin was a major port town on the east coast of Ireland, and the site of Britannia’s largest slave market. It was a major site of Viking occupation, and was ruled until 873 by the Viking lord Imar, often associated with Ivar the Boneless, a son of the legendary Viking warlord Ragnar Lothbrok. Viking raiders had wintered there as early as 840 AD, so their association with the region had been a long one, and over time their customs began to take on a more Gaelic flavour as the slow process of integration took its course. <br><br>By 878 AD however, Imar’s son Bardr was firmly established on the throne. Would this ambitious Viking ruler seek to seal a lasting peace with the surrounding Gaelic factions? Or return to the ways of Ragnar, and pursue a path of bloodshed and domination? It is hard to ignore the calling of one’s warrior-blood… <br><br><strong>Sudreyar</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Eirik</strong><br><br>To the west of Alba lies Sudreyar, the Kingdom of the Southern Isles. Comprising the southern Hebrides, these scattered islands were sparsely populated and, bearing the full brunt of the Atlantic weather, were not lands suited to the less-hardy.<br><br>Like much of Britannia, these islands saw increasing Viking contact from the 8th Century. Prior to this period they formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada, until they fell under Viking control. Over the next century, Scandinavian occupancy took on a distinctly Gaelic flavour (and vice-versa), particularly after 872 AD when Harald Fairhair became king of Norway, and his former opponents flocked to the area.<br><br>Materially poor, but offering an excellent base for those of a nautical bent, the isles of Sudreyar are a perfect staging-post for raiders and explorers."

The theatre of conflict is a bespoke campaign map representing the densely forested landmass stretching from The Reikland Channel in the West to Hochland in the east. The player assumes the role of Legendary Beast-Lord Khazrak The One Eye as he lays waste to the lands of men and attempts to slay his nemesis Boris Todbringer, the Graf of Middenheim. Other Beastmen tribes lurk in the wild woodlands however, and a great show of arms will be required to secure their loyalty…<br><br><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/404012/extras/Map.png?t=1521822879"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Campaign playstyle</strong></h2><br><br><strong>Horde gameplay</strong><br>The Beastmen offer a uniquely aggressive horde-style campaign game, carrying their infrastructure as they travel and never settling in the conventional fashion. Unlike Chaos Warrior hordes however, all Beastmen units bear the Resilience passive ability. This makes them immune to the attrition caused by infighting when two or more hordes stand in close proximity, and promotes a more collaborative approach between hordes.<br><br><strong>Chaos Corruption</strong><br>The Beastmen also spread Chaos Corruption wherever they go, destabilising provinces and causing attrition to enemy forces. With unique Heroes, building chains, tech trees, recruitment options, Lord and Hero skill-trees, and an exclusive Lore of Magic (The Lore of The Wild), they offer a new and feral way to play Total War: WARHAMMER.<br><br><strong>Bestial Rage</strong><br>Each army led by a Beastmen Lord has a Bestial Rage meter. As the army raids or engages in battle, this meter rises until a new Brayherd is summoned – an AI controlled Beastmen horde that can be directed by the player to specific targets, or support the parent army as it moves. If any army’s Bestial Rage falls too low, it may begin infighting, leading to loss of troops and, in the worst instances, mutiny. <br><br><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/404012/extras/Bestial_Rage_-_Copy.jpg?t=1521822879"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br><br><strong>Unique army stances</strong><br>The Beastmen playstyle is also characterised through their unique army stances. Beastmen Ambush is their standard mode of campaign map movement and enables the army to ambush enemy forces on the move. <br><br>The Hidden Encampment stance lets the army melt into the shadows and focus on their infrastructure and recruitment, invisible to all but the keenest-eyed enemy Lords.<br><br>Beast-Paths enables the army to ignore impassable terrain by following the secret paths known only to their kind. If an army is attacked in this stance, the ensuing battle will take place in one of the atmospheric new Beast Path battle-maps. <br><br>Like other races, The Beastmen can also enter the Raiding stance to harvest income, increase Bestial Rage and sow public disorder in enemy territory. <br><br><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/404012/extras/Cygor.png?t=1521822879"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br><br><strong>Unique post-battle options</strong><br>When a Beastmen army conquers an enemy settlement, the player gets two new post-battle options. Raze and Loot harvests income from the settlement before destroying it, while Raze and Defile razes the settlement and erects a blasphemous monument in its place. This generates major Chaos Corruption in the province and confers a large Population Growth bonus upon the horde. <br><br><strong>The Dark Moon rises!</strong><br>The Beastmen share a dark bond with Morrslieb, the Chaos Moon. As it waxes in the night sky, they are given to feats of drunken bacchanalia and ghastly sacrifice beneath its sickly gaze. When a periodic Full Moon event occurs in the Beastmen campaign game, the player must direct his Warherds in which twisted act to perform. There is often a price to be paid for such dark celebrations, but Morrslieb always rewards the faithful!<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Legendary Lords</strong></h2><br><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/404012/extras/Khazrak.png?t=1521822879"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br><br>A Beastmen Grand Campaign may be led by one of two Legendary Lords: the fearsome Beastlord Khazrak The One Eye, or the blasphemous Bray-Shaman, Malagor The Dark Omen. <br><br>Each has their own skill trees, abilities, quest-chains, legendary items, and Grand Campaign start positions. Khazrak begins the Grand Campaign in the Tobaro Region of Estalia, while Malagor begins play in The Marshes of Madness, deep in the Badlands.<br><br><strong>Khazrak The One Eye</strong><br>The bestial intelligence that seethes behind Khazrak’s one good eye makes him the paragon of Beastlords. Gifted with the patience and strategic shrewdness of the most accomplished generals, Khazrak wages the perfect guerrilla war, striking hard and fast where the enemy is weakest, then melting into the shadows to plan the next blow. The only Lord of men ever to best him is Boris Todbringer of Middenheim, who deprived him of an eye with a slash of his Runefang blade.<br><br>Now Khazrak is on the offensive once more. Warherd in tow, he stalks his nemesis through the twisted bowers of Drakland, intending to repay the courtesy in full. An eye for an eye!<br><br>As well as a Beastlord, Khazrak The One Eye is a powerful melee warrior with two quest-chains, rewarding him with the unique items Scourge and The Dark Mail. <br><br>Scourge is a vicious, barbed whip, wrapped in the bitter curses of countless generations of Bray-Shamans. In battle, Scourge improves Khazrak’s Melee Attack and Weapon Strength characteristics; on the Campaign Map, it reduces recruitment costs for Khazrak’s horde, intensifies the Chaos Corruption he generates and increases Khazrak’s post-battle loot amount.<br><br>The Dark Mail is an ancient coat of magical armour that enhances Khazrak’s Armour and Magical Resistance characteristics.<br><br>Khazrak has the abilities Missile Resistance (15%), Resilience, Encourage, Hide (Forest) and Primal Rage (see Unique Abilities below for details).<br><br>If you choose Khazrak The One Eye as your starting Legendary Lord, your race gains +10% income from Raiding and +5 leadership when fighting humans.<br><br><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/404012/extras/Campaign.png?t=1521822879"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br><br><strong>Malagor The Dark Omen</strong><br>To the Beastmen – and indeed, to the inhabitants of The Empire – Malagor is the fleshly incarnation of mankind’s demise. Unsurpassed in his grasp of The Lore of The Wild, the rites he performs are iniquitous enough to quail even the foulest of Bray-Shamans. When Malagor and his hordes descend upon a human settlement, he delights in sacrificing priests on the very altars they served. No act of blasphemy is too abhorrent, no desecration too foul, for Malagor The Dark Omen. <br><br>Malagor has a single quest-chain which rewards him with a unique item, The Icons of Vilification. This filth-encrusted collection of blasphemous relics – the skulls of dead priests, branches torn from the hallowed trees of Athel Loren, and more – reduces the recruitment cost and increases the rank of lesser Bray-Shamans. In battle, The Icons emit an aura that increases the damage output of those around Malagor.<br><br>Malagor has the abilities Missile Resistance (15%), Resilience, Encourage, Hide (Forest) and Primal Rage (see Unique Abilities below for details). Malagor can also unlock a unique skill at level 15: Something Wicked This Way Comes. This confers a permanent Hex spell on Malagor, causing -4 Leadership to nearby enemy units in battle and -3 Leadership to enemy armies in Malagor’s campaign map region.<br><br>If you choose Malagor The Dark Omen as your starting Legendary Lord, your faction can field +1 Bray-Shaman, and all your characters gain +5% movement range.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Lords</strong></h2><br><br>Warherds are commanded by Beastlords, the braying, stomping masters of their kind. Along with Campaign, Battle and Melee skill-trees unique to The Beastmen race, Beastlords also have a number of unique skill unlocks improving their melee attack, melee defence, leadership, weapon strength and missile resistance statistics, making them exceedingly powerful warriors as well as great leaders. Beastlords may also be mounted on Razorgor Chariots from rank 15 onwards.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Heroes</strong></h2><br><br>The Beastmen can recruit and field two unique Hero types. <br><br><strong>Gorebull</strong><br>Gorebulls are hulking, twin-horned melee specialists – the very mightiest examples of Minotaurs. Combat prowess aside, they also boast newly-configured skill-trees offering strong specialisation options. These culminate in powerful passive and active support skills, which enhance the campaign and battle capabilities of any horde they join.<br><br><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/404012/extras/GorebullSmall.jpg?t=1521822879"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br><br><strong>Bray-Shaman</strong><br>Bray-Shamans are spellcaster Heroes, capable of employing The Lore of Death, The Lore of Beasts, or the bestial school of magic known only to The Beastmen, The Lore of The Wild. This Lore boasts a variety of unique Hexes, Augments and Magic Missiles, but arguably its most powerful spell is Savage Dominion, which enables the Bray-Shaman to summon a Cygor directly into the thick of battle!<br><br><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/404012/extras/Bray-ShamanSmall.jpg?t=1521822879"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Battlefield units</strong></h2><br><br><strong>Unique Abilities</strong><br>Units in the Beastmen roster benefit from some unique passive abilities which confer benefits in combat. These are as follows.<br><br><strong>Resilience</strong><br>An ability common to all units in the Beastmen roster, Resilience prevents the attrition caused by infighting between hordes in close proximity on the Campaign map.<br><br><strong>Primal Fury</strong><br>Many Gor units (Ungors, Gors, Bestigors and Centigors) have the Primal Fury ability, which brings a constant active buff to their Speed, Charge Bonus and Melee Attack characteristics.<br><br><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/404012/extras/Primal-FurySmall.jpg?t=1521822879"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br><br><strong>Rowdy</strong><br>Centigors are emboldened when fighting, drinking and feasting together, although such ‘bravery’ is only temporary at best. In battle, they gain immunity to vigour-loss and a leadership bonus.

When he accompanies an army into battle, he typically rides atop the resplendent War Altar of Sigmar, inspiring the soldiers around him to great acts of heroism as he strikes the followers of evil down with powerful blows and words of divine force. Volkmar is a holy terror on the battlefield, a man who fights with the fury of Sigmar himself.

Sometimes a Corpse Cart is hung with a great bell, the clapper of which is a fell lodestone of eldritch provenance. When necromantic magic is thick in the air, the bell tolls and ripples of Dark Magic emanate from the Corpse Cart. <br><br>As a magical support chariot, the Corpse Cart projects a magical aura known as the Vigor Mortis.

Heavy with evil magics and painstakingly illuminated, the Blasphemous Tome the Mortis Engine bears has been crafted with such care that their creator's souls have passed into the leaves of human skin that form its pages. These books can be a boon to the twisted practitioners of necromancy. <br><br>As a magical support chariot, the Mortis Engine Regenerates hitpoints for itself and nearby friendly undead units, and causes magical damage to nearby enemy units within the same radius. The attendant Blasphemous Tome also increases the owner’s Winds of Magic power reserve.

No one can foretell how many will turn up at the muster, or what their fighting quality will be. After all, these irregular troops receive no formal training or discipline. <br><br>Free Company Militia are dual-role hybrid troops.

The creak and groan of living wood echoes from its dim interior, the canopy seems to absorb all light, and half-seen spirits dart between the twilit bowers. To enter is to place your fate in their hands.<br><br>Within dwell the Asrai, the Wood Elves. Though they hail originally from Ulthuan to the west as all Elves do, they spurn the sanctimonious arrogance of the Asur, the High Elves, and the murderous decadence of the Druchii or Dark Elves. The Asrai consider themselves to be the only true Elves left in the world, as they embrace all aspects of their nature – both light and dark – and for thousands of years, they have lived in harmony with the sentient forest.<br><br>The Asrai share the wilds of Athel Loren with its spirits and protectors: the Dryads, Branchwraiths and the ancient guardian Treemen. They adopt its steeds, hawks and Great Eagles for their warhosts, and even rare Forest Dragons may deign to join them when the need is dire. Peerless archers and riders, the Wood Elves pay fealty to the demigod Orion, who dies in flame each midwinter, only to be reborn into thunderous life in spring beneath The Oak of Ages.<br><br>Wild, lithe, and utterly ruthless in defence of their land, only a fool would goad the Wood Elves and their spirited allies to conflict. For those who witness the awesome spectacle of an Asrai host marching out of the woodlands on a Wild Hunt, it is likely the last thing they will ever see.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Campaign playstyle</h2><br>The Wood Elves campaign offers a uniquely different campaign experience to the other playable races of Total War: WARHAMMER. Their major infrastructure is housed in the Wood Elf settlements of Athel Loren, though they are capable of expanding outwards, capturing settlements and building limited outposts, known as Asrai Lookouts, in their stead. The heart of the campaign is The Great Oak, a unique 5-tier building related to the new Wonder victory condition.<br><br>In battle, the Wood Elves are swift and deadly, fielding many ‘glass cannon’ style units. While less physically robust than most other races, and with smaller unit sizes, they make up for this with excellent melee and ranged capabilities. They field some of the best archers in the game, many of whom can move and fire, and may later be upgraded with a range of specialised ammunition. They are often accompanied in battle by the woodland kin of Athel Loren, such as Dryads, Eagles and Treemen. Their spellcasters wield the Lores of Life, Beasts and Shadows.<br><br>New Story Campaign: The Season of Revelation<br>Set across a beautiful and highly-detailed campaign map of Athel Loren and the surrounding Duchies of Breton, The Season of Revelation is playable as either Durthu or Orion, the Wood Elves’ two Legendary Lords. This campaign tasks the player with uniting Athel Loren in the face of Bretonnian incursions and, later, from a series of fearsome, climactic attacks by the Beastman warlord Morghur, and his corrupted bray-herds.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Oak of Ages</h2><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/534331/extras/GIF2.jpg?t=1521822876"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br>The vast, ancient bowers of The Oak of Ages mark the spiritual heart of Athel Loren and the source of its sacred power.<br><br>In the Grand Campaign, The Oak of Ages is a unique 5-tier Wonder building sited in Athel Loren which the player must grow over the course of the campaign. As the Wood Elf player advances it to each new tier, they will receive increasing bonuses to their campaign.<br><br>Growing The Oak to tier 5 initiates The Battle of The Great Oak, a climactic multi-stage assault on Athel Loren’s spiritual centre by the combined and massed hordes of the Beastmen and Chaos Warriors. Victory (or survival!) marks the completion of the Wood Elves’ key campaign objective. <br><br>New additional currency: Amber<br>Alongside Gold, the Wood Elves require Amber to recruit certain elite units, to unlock certain technologies, and to expand the Oak of Ages. This is a finite resource in the world however, and can only be gained by capturing settlements and setting up Asrai Lookouts. <br><br>As Amber is limited, this presents the player with a constant choice over whether it should be spent on faction development, military might or achieving their key victory condition.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Wood Elf Settlements and Outposts</h2><br>The Wood Elves are capable of capturing any province in The Old World, regardless of its race origin. However, these settlement locations can only ever house Asrai Lookouts with very limited building options, turning them into army replenishment stops, recruitment stations (with access to the global recruitment pool but at local recruitment pricing), or as centres to exploit any regional trade resources. Major building chains will need to be built in the regions of Athel Loren itself, the only true home of the Wood Elves. Settlements in Athel Loren have 10 building slots, providing space to explore the Wood Elves’ extensive building trees.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Wood Elves infrastructure</h2><br>The Wood Elves have unique tech trees and buildings, and as a highly developed and somewhat aristocratic race, the Wood Elf Council presides over matters social and military. <br><br>This Council has a number of Offices to which characters may be appointed, and is subtly connected to the Wood Elves’ infrastructure. Certain buildings unlock Offices for example: if the Wild Heath building is unlocked in the tech tree, it can be built in a settlement, thereby unlocking the Herald Of The Hunt office. If one of the player’s Lords is appointed to this role, he will periodically call a Wild Hunt. This gives the Herald and his army a series of very significant bonuses for the turns in which the Wild Hunt event is active, heightening their marshal prowess and encouraging aggressive actions. Players are advised to explore these interconnections in order to get the most out of their Wood Elf campaigns.<br><br>The two Wood Elves legendary Lords, Orion and Durthu, both have Offices to which only they can be appointed, providing them with further campaign bonuses.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">New Legendary Lords</h2><br>A Wood Elves Grand Campaign may be led by one of two Legendary Lords: the demigod Orion, The King in The Woods, or the ancient Treeman, Durthu. Each begins play in a different starting position, controlling a different Athel Loren faction, and bring their own suite of campaign bonuses.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Orion The King in The Woods</h2><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/534331/extras/GIF3.jpg?t=1521822876"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br>Orion is the immortal demigod-king of Athel Loren and the Wood Elves. When his realm is threatened, he is the first to take up arms and fight in its defence. Every Elf feels the lure of their king’s wild summons, and many are overcome by their primal urges, abandoning civilised concerns and for the thrill of the hunt, and the heady tang of blood upon the wind. <br><br>Orion is a powerful melee warrior who also can deal sizeable ranged damage with his long-range spear attacks. He also has two unique area-effect abilities: Hounds of Orion, a magical vortex, and Hawk’s Talon, a magical bombardment. These attacks are bound to Orion and do not consume Winds of Magic.<br><br>Orion has two combat skill trees, two battle skill trees, and a campaign skill tree. This great range of skills, many of which are unique, allows him to specialise as he levels up. In particular, he can bring numerous improvements to the many bow units in the Wood Elves roster. When recruiting forces, Orion must pay an extra cost in Amber to hire woodland spirit units.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Durthu</h2><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/534331/extras/GIF4.jpg?t=1521822876"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br>Most ancient of the might Treemen of Athel Loren, Durthu was once a benevolent creature who found joy in the weave of forest life. It was he who first bound the spirits of the woodlands to the fate of the Asrai. And for a time, things existed in balance and harmony.<br><br>After many bloody incursions into Athel Loren however, with countless tress felled by outsiders for fuel, or merely out of spite, Durthu has become embittered. Worse still, he believes the Wood Elves themselves invited many of these calamities. Now, he does not consider them friends: merely allies in a common cause. <br><br>In the grand Campaign, Durthu leads the woodland spirits of the region of Argwylon in Athel Loren.  When recruiting forces, he must pay an extra cost in Amber to hire Wood Elf units. A powerful warrior and spellcaster, Durthu also wields the Lore of Beasts, and may summon Manticores into the thick of battle using The Transformation of Kadon.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">New Lords</h2><br>Wood Elves armies may recruit two new types of Lord to command their armies: Glade lords and Treemen.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Glade Lords</h2><br>The Highborn lords and ladies of Athel Loren have ruled the Wood Elves for millennia, and when the race goes to war, it is these nobles that direct their forces. Powerful warriors and excellent archers, they have two personal combat skill trees, each of which brings improvements to their archery and melee abilities. Likewise, their Battle trees augment their armies along two different paths – mell and ranged. They may also unlock three mount options as they level up: the Elven Steed, Great Eagle, and Forest Dragon.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Ancient Treemen</h2><br>Ancient Treemen are colossal in stature. Revered by Elf and forest-creature alike, their strength rivals that of even the dragons of the deep glades. The true guardians of the forest, these mighty woodland spirits are Spellcaster lords who wield the Lore of Beasts. While they have no mount options (there are few creatures in the world big enough to accommodate them), they have unique skills which grant increasing protection to all Tree Kin units in their armies.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Heroes</h2><br>Wood Elves armies may recruit three new types of Hero units to support their armies and perform Campaign Map actions. Each offers strong specialisation paths via their skill trees.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Spellsingers (Mage focus)</h2><br>Wood Elf mages have a unique relationship with Athel Loren. Connected to the deeper intelligence of the forest, they are highly attuned beings, sharing a bond with their surroundings in much the same way the Dryads, sprites and Treemen do. Spellsingers may be recruited to wield the Lores of Life, Shadow and Beasts.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Branchwraiths (Melee/Mage focus)</h2><br>Eldest of the Dryads, Branchwraith serve as handmaidens to the ancients of Athel Loren. Before the coming of the Elves, it was they who ruled the forest and tamed the Winds of Magic to bring sustenance to the wild woodlands. There is no love lost between Branchwraiths and the Asrai, though the uneasy peace continues, and these skilled practitioners of The Lore of Life can be found in many Wood Elf warhosts, casting spells in the thick of battle one minute, striking down foes with their powerful limbs the next.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Waystalkers (Spy, Ranged focus)</h2><br>The most skilled marksmen of the Waywatchers, Waystalkers are obsessed with The Hunt. Taciturn, solitary individuals, they show a dedication to their path that puts them in closer touch with the forest than their Elven kin. Expert snipers, they can move – and even remain hidden – while firing, singling out targets for the kill with a ruthless precision that no other archer can match.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Unit roster</h2><br>The Wood Elves roster contains many skilled archer units. When certain structures have been built, Glade Guard, Deepwood Scouts and Glade Riders may be recruited to fire three specialised ammunition types:<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Starfire shafts (Fire damage)<br></li><li>Hagbane Tips (Poison damage)<br></li><li>Swift Silver Shards (Magical damage)</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Melee Infantry</h2>Eternal Guard<br><br>Eternal Guard (shields)<br>Wardancers<br>Wardancers (Asrai spears)<br>Wildwood Rangers<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Ranged infantry</h2>Glade Guard<br><br>Glade Guard (Starfire Shafts)<br>Glade Guard (Hagbane Tips)<br>Deepwood Scouts<br>Deepwood Scouts (Swift Shiver Shafts)<br>Waywatchers<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Melee Cavalry</h2>Wild Riders<br><br>Wild Riders (shields)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Ranged cavalry </h2>Glade Riders<br><br>Glade Riders (Hagbane Tips)<br>Hawk Riders (flying)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Magical cavalry</h2>Sisters of The Thorn (may cast bound spells)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Woodland Spirit units</h2>Dryads<br>Treekin<br>Treeman<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Monstrous Units</h2>Great Eagle (flying)<br>Forest Dragon (flying)"

It is a lifeless realm of endless dunes, stained red from the blood of savages and barbarians. This is the Land of the Dead, where mummified kings are cursed to rule in perpetual unlife. But it was not always thus.<br><br>There was a time when the ancient kingdom of Nehekhara stood as a crown of human civilisation; a golden age when its cities shone with majestic splendour, its armies conquered entire nations and its kings ruled as gods among men. But this realm was razed millennia ago by the treacherous sorcery of reviled Nagash: in a stroke, the living perished and the dead rose from their tombs.<br><br>Death is no barrier to glory for the Tomb Kings however.

Instead, they seek the nine cursed Books of Nagash, a search culminating in an epic battle at the Black Pyramid of Nagash itself. Each of these books grants a unique campaign bonus, and puts the player a step further along the road to victory.<br><br><strong>Unique resource: Canopic Jars</strong><br>Ancient containers filled with arcane energy, Canopic Jars can be collected through missions, buildings, and as post-battle loot. They are used to awaken powerful units, unlock techs, perform rites and to craft unique items in the Mortuary Cult. <br><br><strong>The Mortuary Cult</strong><br>Keepers of the Lore of Nehekhara and the secrets of revivification, the Liche Priests of the Mortuary Cult can be called upon to construct unique and venerable items. Using a combination of trade resources and Canopic Jars, the player can order the construction of unique magic weapons, armour, talismans, plus enchanted and arcane items. For a cost, the Mortuary Cult can also resurrect powerful Legions of Legend for use in your armies. <br><br><strong>The Dynasties of Nehekhara</strong><br>Rather than developing new technologies, the Tomb Kings seek to unearth the achievements of their dynastic forbears. By studying these histories, players can resurrect great rulers of the past to serve as Lords for their armies, increase capacity for the various Tomb Kings Heroes, unlock a host of campaign and unit buffs, and awaken the Heralds of ancient armies – unique followers who bring powerful bonuses to key unit types in an army. <br><br><br><strong>Rites</strong><br>The Tomb Kings have four unique Rites which may be unlocked and used in campaign:<br><br><strong>Great Incantation of Ptra</strong><br>Invoking the sun god summons Ptra’s Necrotect, a unique Hero character capable of colonising ruins at city level 3.<br><br><strong>Great Incantation of Khsar</strong><br>Invoking the god of the desert wind generates sandstorms across all player-owned regions. This causes attrition to foreign armies, increases your ambush success chance and confers the army ability Sand Veil (enables a unit to become Hidden and gain Stalk in battle, making them invisible to the enemy until they draw very close).<br><br><strong>Great Incantation of Geheb</strong><br>Invoking the god of strength increases Canopic Jar generation and province growth, reduces construction time, and confers the army ability Tombswarm (a swirling swarm of Scarabs which damages the target and moves in the same manner as a vortex spell).<br><br><strong>Great Incantation of Tahoth</strong><br>Invoking the god of scholars adds a Casket of Souls magical artillery unit to the recruitment pool. It also confers a rank bonus to newly recruited Tomb Kings and unit recruits, and increases recruitment capacity factionwide.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Legendary Lords</strong></h2><br><br>The Tomb Kings feature four playable Legendary Lords, each with their own abilities, campaign bonuses, skill trees, quest-chains and campaign start-positions in both the Eye of the Vortex campaign and Mortal Empires.<br><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/617870/extras/GIF3.jpg?t=1522072963"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br><strong>Settra The Imperishable</strong><br>Settra is the king of all Tomb Kings. He is a ruthless leader whose thirst for conquest knows no bounds. Unlike other Tomb Kings, his unyielding will is such that he never needs to return to his sarcophagus to rest. The immortality he so desired in life is now his, and the civilisations that flourished in his absence now feel his wrath. <br><br>Settra is a great leader, bringing bonuses to growth and public order, while reducing construction time. He also confers bonus armour to Skeleton Chariot and Tomb Guard units, and has a selection of unlockable mounts, including the Khemrian Warsphinx and the flame-wreathed Chariot of the Gods.<br><br><br><strong>High Queen Khalida</strong><br>The Warrior-Queen of Lybaras was famed for her intelligence, honour and bravery. Her reign was cut tragically short by her cousin Neferata, who had attempted to create the Elixir of Life. Instead of true immortality though, Neferata’s flawed potion granted the twisted form known as Vampirism, and as the first Vampire slew her cousin in combat, she granted her the Blood Kiss. With her last breath, Khalida cried out to Asaph, the serpent goddess, who purified her of the taint. She is now the Goddess’ chosen, with Asaph’s divine venom coursing through her veins.<br><br>Khalida reduces all forms of corruption, enjoys a diplomatic relations bonus with other Tomb Kings factions and grants a hefty bonus to ammunition for all ranged units across her faction. She also confers poison attacks on all units in her army and suffers considerably less from attrition effects. <br><br><br><strong>Grand Hierophant Khatep</strong><br>The head of the Mortuary Cult’s Hieorphantic Council, Khatep is the oldest and wisest of the Liche Priests, and the first of them to deny death’s embrace. It was Khatep who awoke Settra to unlife after Nagash’s Great Ritual levelled Nehekhara, but Settra’s distrust of the Mortuary Cult led him to exile Khatep. Now he roams the Land of the Dead, assisting the Tomb Kings where he can and seeking a way to restore himself in the eyes of Settra.<br><br>Khatep grants a bonus to Dynasty research rate, and improves casualty replenishment and army movement factionwide. He can also recruit a higher number of Liche Priest Heroes, and recruits them at a higher rank. <br><br><br><strong>Arkhan the Black</strong><br>Nagash’s principle lieutenant, Arkhan helped lead the coup which brought the hated arch-necromancer to initial power. He led many armies against Nagash’s enemies, and was finally slain in a suicidal counter-attack against the Priest King’s soldiers that enabled Nagash to escape. He was raised again by his master to become the Liche King, and for countless generations since Nagash’s death at the hands of King Alcadizaar, he has vented his wrath on the lands of the living.   <br><br>Arkhan enjoys bonus diplomatic relations with Vampire Counts factions, and his regions never suffer public order penalties from Vampiric corruption. Heroes embedded in his army gain melee attack and melee defence bonuses, and all his armies factionwide gain a boost to their Winds of Magic Power Reserve. <br><br><br><strong>New Lord: Tomb King</strong><br>Tomb Kings are the principle Lords which lead the armies of Nehekhara. A number will appear as standard in the recruitment pool, but unique, named Tomb Kings – famous rulers from the six dynasties of Nehekharan history – may be resurrected via the Dynasties panel, at which point they enter your Lords recruitment pool. Tomb kings may unlock the Skeletal Steed, Skeleton Chariot, and Khemrian Warsphinx as mounts.<br><br><strong>New Hero: Tomb Prince</strong><br>Following the example of their kings, Tomb Princes aspire to greatness in all things. They form the principle champions of the Nehekharan forces in battle, and have a unique Curse ability which makes targeted enemies enter a state of Rampage. Tomb princes may unlock Skeletal Steeds and Skeletal Chariots as mounts.<br><br><strong>New Hero: Liche Priest</strong><br>The adepts of the Mortuary Cult are the Tomb King’s principle sorcerers. They may be recruited to wield the Lore of Light, the Lore of Death, or the Lore of Nehekhara, and have a unique Curse ability which reduces enemy armour values. They also gain the Immortal skill earlier than other agents. Liche priests may unlock Skeletal Steeds and Skeleton Chariots as mounts.<br><br><strong>New Hero: Necrotect</strong><br>Representing millennia of architectural wisdom, Necrotects are the builders and taskmasters of Nehekhara. They perform a number of functions, such as reducing building costs and increasing movement speed when embedded in your armies, but also fulfil a key support role in battle. As master masons, they provide passive aura-based buffs to Construct units such as Ushabti, Tomb Scorpions and Hierotitans, improving their combat abilities in a number of ways. Necrotects may unlock Skeletal Steeds and Skeleton Chariots as mounts.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Battle gameplay</strong></h2><br><br><strong>The Realm of Souls </strong><br>The Realm of Souls is the revered afterlife of Nehekharan legend, and the origin of the Liche Priests’ magical power. As more of your warriors fall to the enemy in battle, more souls enter the Realm, which is tracked in the battle UI. At three key thresholds, the Realm of Souls triggers a mass healing-wave among your skeletal units, each wave becoming successively more powerful. After the final wave, the player also gains an army ability allowing them to summon a unit of statuesque Ushabti anywhere on the battlefield.  <br><br><strong>The Lore of Nehekhara</strong><br>In battle, Liche Priests may harness the power of the desert gods and wield the Tomb King’s signature magic, the Lore of Nehekhara."

(Nov 2017)<br><br>The latest massive update for Trainz: A New Era delivers better stability, smoother performance and improved compatibility, along with plenty of bug fixes and enhancements across the board. <br><br>After almost 3 years of free updates since the first &quot;Community Edition&quot; was released in 2014, with each major update we've been working hard to ensure that all players can experience the best Trainz has to offer.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><u><strong>Platinum Edition Bundle</strong></u></h2>In conjunction with the latest update, we've also released a &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; bundle to provide fantastic value for new or existing customers. New customers can get almost double the content that was included in the original Standard Edition, at 75% off the regular pricing.<br><br>Existing customers can also expand their collection with 75% off the items they don't already own. In addition, we've retired the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; with it's four extra routes and replaced it with the mcu-better-value Platinum Edition.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><u><strong>What makes Trainz so special?</strong></u></h2><br>Trainz: A New Era is far more than a train simulator. Sure there are hundreds of locos and dozens of routes and sessions you can drive in the Platinum Edition Bundle. But the real power of Trainz comes with all the extra things you can do beyond the builtin-in content set.<br><br>All the tools to build your own railroad are included, and in fact, every route you see in Trainz is created by customers just like you. There are now well over 10,000 routes available on the Trainz Download Station (DLS) that you can download for free and enjoy. So when people tell you &quot;you have to buy lots of DLC&quot; remind them that the choice is theirs, with plenty of high quality free routes and content available on the DLS.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><u><strong>Key Features</strong></u></h2><h2 class=""bb_tag"">All-new graphics engine with full world shadows and per-pixel lighting</h2><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/graphics_engineC.png?t=1520558831"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Multiplayer</h2> <br>Share your enthusiasm with other rail fans and combine your efforts with others to operate a working rail line!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Our most accurate simulation yet with real time world physics and editing tools!</h2><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/PhysicsC.png?t=1520558831"" ><br><br>Our physics use a variety of configurable inputs such as engine powers, train weight and rolling resistance whilst taking into account factors like track gradient, curve resistance and track adhesion for each train car when accelerating or decelerating. The brand new real time physics editing tools allow players to tune physics 'on-the-fly' to take their simulation's performance even further.<br><br>Brand-new Real-time Physics Editing tools enable users to enter known specifications to accurately monitor all the forces at work. Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted &quot;on-the-fly&quot;. By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car).<br><br>If physics aren't your thing, don't worry.

719c7ffa-e697-4a55-826d-43d482bf7d27,Verdun,"Вердюн е първият мултиплеър от типа Стрелба от първо лице (FPS), поставен в реалистичната обстановка на Първата световна война. Безпощадната окопна война предлага уникален опит на бойното поле, като потапя Вас и Вашия отряд в напрегнати битки с атака и защита.<br><br>Играта се води на Западния фронт между 1914 и 1918 година, в един от най-кръвопролитните конфликти в историята на човечеството. Разработчиците се вдъхновяват от безславната Битка при Вердюн през 1916 година. Играта предлага 4 различни типа игра: Фронтови линии, Война на изтощение, Бой до смърт с оръжия и Отбранителен отряд. Присъстват и много исторически точни характеристики, като реалистични оръжия, автентични униформи от Първата световна война, ужасяващо насилие, както и карти на база на реалните бойни полета във Франция и Белгия.<br><br>Типът игра Фронтови линии е уникален в своята тактическа сложност. В реалистичните окопи битката е трудна и изисква тактически умения за завземане и защитаване. Антантата и Централните сили се стремят да получат контрол над участъците на фронтовата линия. В една битка ще се втурвате в окопите на врага по време на нападение, за да завземете земя, докато в друга може да защитавате наскоро завоюваната от Вас земя от яростната контра атака на врага.<br><br>Играчите могат да избират да са част от един от многото видове отряди в играта, всеки от които има своя специална тактическа роля. Като работите заедно с приятелите си можете да натрупвате опит, който да подобри мощта и многофункционалността на Вашия отряд. Като натрупвате повече опит в битките и Ви повишават в ранг, Вие печелите Кариерни точки, които можете да използвате за отключване на специални умения, оръжия и оборудване.<br><br>В типа игра Война на изтощение, Антантата и Централните сили са се окопали едни срещу други в една единствена битка. Всяка страна има няколко билета, които показват броя на бойците й. Когато играч бъде убит и се съживи, един билет се взима от страната, на която се е бил. Когато дадена страна няма повече билети, играчите на тази страна не могат да се съживяват ¬ тази, която остане последна печели!<br><br>Бой до смърт с оръжия е тип игра, безплатна за всички, в която играчите са в окопите един срещу друг във вълнуващо състезание на умения, като използват само еднозарядни оръжия.<br><br>В типа игра Отбранителен отряд играчът, заедно с трима от отряда ще трябва да защитават позиция докато могат срещу безкрайните вълни на нападателите, ръководени от Изкуствения интелект (AI).<br><br>Основните характеристики на Вердюн са:<br>•<strong>Реалистичен сюжет от Първата световна война:</strong> Автентични оръжия с реалистична динамика на куршума, умело боравене с оръжието, насилие, отровен газ с клаустрофобични газови маски, ужасяващо насилие и артилерийски заграждения<br>•<strong>Тактическа игра „Стрелба от първо лице с отряд“ (FPS):</strong> Уникална система за планиране на отряда, специални видове отряди и роли, гласов чат<br>•<strong>Истинска окопна война:</strong> Сюжет с динамична фронтова линия със светкавична атака и контраатака в движение<br>•<strong>Автентична обстановка от Първата световна война:</strong> Музика и стил, типични за Първата световна война, исторически бойни полета от Западния фронт<br>•<strong>Трудни типове игра:</strong> Фронтова линия на база екип, тактическа Война на изтощение, Бой до смърт с оръжия на база умения и отчаяно оцеляване в Отбранителен отряд<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/242860/extras/Steam_text_divider.png?t=1519401400"" ><br><br>РЕАЛИСТИЧЕН СЮЖЕТ ОТ ПЪРВАТА СВЕТОВНА ВОЙНА<br>Сюжетът на играта е толкова завладяващ и подробен, доколкото може да е с елементи като реалистично насилие, което показва истинския ужас на бойното поле на Първата световна война. Разбира се, тази характеристика може да се деактивира, ако предпочитате. Трябва умело да боравите с автентичните оръжия, тъй като всички се държат различно и няма плаващ мерник, който да Ви помогне в прицелването. И реалистичната динамика на траекторията на куршумите изисква от Вас да насочвате изстрелите си, когато стреляте по движеща се мишена на дълго разстояние. Ако има газова атака трябва да поставите маската за газ, която Ви пречи да виждате и Ви връхлита клаустрофобията. Ако не е достатъчно да Ви застрелят или обгазят, внезапните артилеристки нападения от сержантите могат да Ви убият, ако бъдете хванати и целият Ви отряд да бъде унищожен. Тази безмилостна война не е за хора със слаби нерви!<br><br>ТАКТИЧЕСКА ИГРА „СТРЕЛБА ОТ ПЪРВО ЛИЦЕ“ С ОТРЯД<br>Екипната игра е в основата на играта „Вердюн“. Когато започнете играта, първият Ви избор е да се биете или за Антантата, или за Централните сили. Можете да сформирате един от различните видове отряди, налични за тази страна с до трима от Вашите приятели. Всеки отряд има специфична тактика, която се базира на историческите формирования по това време. В зависимост от вида на Вашия отряд, играчите могат да изберат конкретна роля в рамките на отряда, допълнена с исторически точно облекло, оръжия и специални умения. Колкото повече съвместен опит добиете Вие и Вашите другари от отряда, толкова по-силен ще стане Вашият отряд и ще се отключат по-добри способности. Този напредък се показва и визуално, тъй като Вие и отряда получавате по-усъвършенствани униформи. Ще спечелите и Кариерни точки, които могат да се използват за отключване на специални умения, оръжия и оборудване.<br><br>ИСТИНСКА ОКОПНА ВОЙНА<br>Преживяването на истинско бойно поле от Първата световна война е уловено в динамичната фронтова линия в реално време, поставено в исторически точни места на Западния фронт. Тези карти на фронтовата линия се състоят от много участъци, които могат да бъдат завзети от всяка една страна. Като остават верни на типичната война на изтощение от онова време, двете страни последователно се атакуват и контраатакуват едни други, като Ви карат да защитавате всеки завладян участък с окопи!<br><br>АВТЕНТИЧНА ОБСТАНОВКА НА ПЪРВАТА СВЕТОВНА ВОЙНА<br>Екипът от разработчици подробно е проучил битката при Вердюн и е имал за съветници добре информирани историци, за да е сигурен, че играта „Вердюн“ е възможно най-точна в исторически аспект. Униформите са възпроизведени до най-дребния детайл, оръжията са моделирани според оръжията от това време, а картите използват реалистичните декори и макети на терена от Първата световна война. Всичко в играта е така направено, че да пресъздаде зловещата атмосфера, типична за Първата световна война; Мрачно, облачно небе, завладяващ интерфейс, комбиниран с реалистични звуци, точни местни гласове, които създават усещане, че действително сте там в окопите, в покритите с кал окопи, докато надничате над пушката си, за да видите противника."

The Dark Gods are at last united in a singular purpose, losing their madness across the world as never before. In the Empire of Sigmar, Karl Franz's gaze is focused on the incursion of the savage northmen, but it is not the only threat. As the Chaos moon Morrslieb waxes full, shrill voices echo through tunnels gnawed far beneath the Empire's cities, and a Skaven host swarms towards the surface. It emerges first in the city of Ubersreik, a screeching mass that consumes all before it. Soon Ubersreik is a charnel-town, drowning beneath the malevolent shadow of the Horned Rat. <br><br>Yet even in the darkest times, there are always champions to light the way. As Ubersreik cowers, five heroes, united by capricious fate, carry the fight to the rat-men. It remains to be seen whether they have the strength to survive, let alone work together long enough to thwart the invaders. One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them. </i>"
