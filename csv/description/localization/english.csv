Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/TameTrainBreedRide.png?t=1508277167"" ><br><br>Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/FoodWaterTemp.png?t=1508277167"" ><br><br>You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/HarvestBuildPaint.png?t=1508277167"" ><br><br> By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/PlantFarmGrow.png?t=1508277167"" ><br><br>Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/Summon.png?t=1508277167"" ><br><br>By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/Tribes.png?t=1508277167"" ><br><br>Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management.

More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/HardcoreMechanics.png?t=1508277167"" ><br><br>Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/346110/extras/ExploreAndDiscover.png?t=1508277167"" ><br><br>The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK?

A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items!

Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike.<br> <br><br>Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brütal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs.<br><br><br><strong>Story</strong><br>The vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.<br><br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Brütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.<br><br><br><strong>A Streaming Open World</strong><br>Brütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting.<br><br><br><strong>Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent</strong><br>Brütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.<br><br><br><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem</strong><br>4v4 &quot;skirmish&quot; multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brütal Legend’s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play).<br><br><br><strong>Music</strong><br>The music in Brütal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself."

The central temple provides a key overwatch position, and adds verticality to the subterranean sections beneath the temple’s foundations. These underground sections, cliffside trails and stairwells create a myriad of pathways and flanking routes so players will never be far from the frantic action.<br><br>Skilled players that find and complete the map's unique Field Order will have the ability to become one of the galaxy's ultimate hunters, the deadly Predator. As the Predator, players will brandish its dual wrist blades and shoulder-mounted plasma cannon, as well as be able to utilize the creature's keen hunting abilities to track down enemy players.<br><br><strong>BEHEMOTH</strong><br><i>Location: Columbia</i><br><br>Situated on a massive bucket-wheel excavator (BWE), one of the largest vehicles ever created, Behemoth is a narrow, multi-level map. Long sight lines open Behemoth up to longer-range weapons, while BWE’s core walkways offer tight interior control rooms, ideal for those who prefer close-quarters combat.

With the mangled remains of the bridge, burnt out vehicles, and shipping containers strewn across the deck, this map provides the ideal theatre for tight, close-quarters combat.<br><br>Two dominant structures at each end of the map provide great vantage points and sightlines from which players can provide teammates with enemy locations, or take matters into their own hands. At the same time, the ship’s maze-like underbelly is made up of narrow corridors and tight corners, which may well put players face to face with opposing enemies sooner than hoped for.<br><br>Unlock the map’s unique Killstreak by completing the Field Order, giving players an A-10 Warthog aircraft on standby to engage in strafing runs across the length of the map, using its full arsenal of missiles and a chain gun capable of unleashing 30mm rounds at thousands of rounds-per-minute.<br><br><strong>UNEARTHED</strong><br><i>Location: Classified</i><br><br>Inspired by Dome, the fan-favorite map from Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 3, Unearthed drops players at the heart of an alien dig site. Unearthed lies amidst the shadows of mysterious ancient statues, and at its heart is an ancient meteorite - the focus of the excavation.<br><br>This small map has players navigate through Cryptid artifacts, a mix of high-tech HAZMAT facilities, scientific equipment and vehicles. The re-imagining sees the addition of an all-new flanking route, and a large crane that provides a crucial vantage point overlooking the entire map. However, this dominant position is one that will leave you vulnerable to eagle-eyed enemies.<br><br>Players skilled enough to complete Unearthed’s unique Field Order will be able to unleash three Cryptid alien creatures, delivering an explosive end to their foes.<br><br><strong>The Ripper</strong><br><br>The Ripper is the ideal weapon companion for Devastation’s mix of multiplayer maps.

This unique 2-in-1 weapon has the ability to switch from SMG to AR and back again on the fly in the midst of battle, at the touch of a button, giving maximum flexibility to adjust to a variety of map types and tactics.<br><br><strong>Extinction - Episode 2: Mayday</strong><br><i>Location: Tasman Sea, South Pacific</i><br><br>In the aftermath of Episode 1: Nightfall, the Quick Reaction Force team is sent in to investigate a high-tech ghost ship adrift in the South Pacific. Upon boarding, players must battle through swarms of Cryptids as they progress deeper and discover the sophisticated laboratory facilities below deck, where researchers are developing a machine to locate the mysterious beings who engineered the Cryptids. In the midst of the action, players will uncover a conspiracy, along with surprising twists where the line between friend and foe become blurred.<br><br>In Episode 2: Mayday your team will need new weapons and new tactics to deal with the insidious wall-crawling “Seeder,” and the skyscraper-sized monstrosity known as the “Kraken.” To survive, players must explore the ship’s cavernous environment, scavenge supplies and construct improvised weapons and traps from blueprints found onboard."

At a remote facility in the Alaskan wilderness, the shadowy Nightfall Program has been researching the origins of the “Alien” threat.

Your enemies may grunt unintelligibly, but that doesn’t mean they’re stupid. Defeating these beasts will require thoughtful strategies, clever tactics, and the right combination of three Champions out of the five. Choose well, and the combined strength of your Champions’ elemental powers will carve through your enemies like a hot sword through molten lava. Choose poorly, and you’ll be monster chow. At any time, you can pause the game, switch up your tactics, and rejoin the melee without missing a beat.

*CONQUER A DAZZLING WORLD*
From parched deserts to mysterious forests, from frozen snowfields to tropical jungles, the lethally-beautiful world of Anteria invites you to blaze your own path to victory. Choose who, when, and where you’ll attack or defend on a Progression Map. Just remember that your decisions directly affect the world around you, and every action has a consequence.

*PROVE YOURSELF IN STUNNING BOSS BATTLES*
They’re big, they’re nasty, and they’re hoping to mince your Champions into bite-sized bits. They’re the bosses of Anteria, and you’ll need sound strategies and lightning-fast combat moves to bring them down. Change your tactics on the fly, avoid the bosses’ lethal traps, and deliver a smackdown worthy of the ages.

*CREATE THE ULTIMATE WARRIORS*
After each mission, return to your stronghold to develop your city and craft potions, armor, weapons, and other lethal tools to make your Champions stronger — and make life even more miserable for your enemies. 

*RESCUE A WAR-TORN WORLD*
As players progress through Anteria, they discover a narrative of a beautiful land brought to its knees by years of constant strife among battling clans. But as your heroes strive to bring peace to this magical realm, they must confront a malevolent wizard and his undead army, neither of whom are known for being particularly peaceful."

As FBI agent Ethan Thomas, you rely on sharp instincts and sophisticated forensic tools to investigate crime scenes, collect evidence, and find clues that will lead you to the killers. With danger lurking in every shadow, you need whatever weapons you can find to stay alive. If you run out of bullets, you’ll have to fight with a fire axe, shovel, pipe, two-by-four, or whatever you can pry from the environment around you. You’ll need to make sure nothing stops you as you try to uncover exactly who...or what is behind the grisly killings plaguing the city."

<br />
Originally released by LucasArts in 1993 as a sequel to Ron Gilbert’s ground breaking Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle is a mind-bending, time travel, cartoon puzzle adventure game in which three unlikely friends work together to prevent an evil mutated purple tentacle from taking over the world!<br />
<br />
Now, over twenty years later, Day of the Tentacle is back in a remastered edition that features all new hand-drawn, high resolution artwork, with remastered audio, music and sound effects (which the original 90s marketing blurb described as ‘zany!’).<br />
<br />
Players are able to switch back and forth between classic and remastered modes, and mix and match audio, graphics and user interface to their heart’s desire. We’ve also included a concept art browser, and recorded a commentary track with the game’s original creators Tim Schafer, Dave Grossman, Larry Ahern, Peter Chan, Peter McConnell and Clint Bajakian.<br />
<br />
Day of the Tentacle was Tim Schafer’s first game as co-project lead, and a much beloved cult classic! This special edition has been lovingly restored and remade with the care and attention that can only come from involving the game's original creators."

James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain.

Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike.<br><br><br>Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well.<br><br>But life has its ways of changing one's perspective.

In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed.

It distills the essence of the fighting game genre into just two buttons with no d-pad directional movement. Divekick’s focused gameplay demonstrates how much depth a single move actually has, and introduces (or reinforces) skills fundamental to the genre: mind games, spacing, timing, and quick reactions.<br><br>At Iron Galaxy we love fighting games. To the average fan, most of what makes them fun is hidden behind a never-ending series of input combinations that they have to memorize. That’s why Divekick has just two buttons: Dive (into the air) makes your character jump straight up. Kick causes your character to fly foot first at a downward angle. If you press Kick on the ground, you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves, the first hit will win the round, and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game. It’s pure adrenaline, awareness, and outsmarting your enemy. It’s a fighting game deconstructed into its purest form. <br><br><strong>Key Features</strong><br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>14+ Completely unique and original characters, each with their own fighting style and special techniques.  <br></li><li>Includes two extra playable characters: Fencer from Nidhogg and Johnny Gat from Saints Row!<br></li><li>A story for every character in the game, including an intro, ending, and rival battles.

Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. <br>Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment group called “The Order”, Dante is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement. <br><br>For DmC Capcom has teamed up with UK development studio, Ninja Theory, renown for delivering action titles with compelling characters and narrative coupled with high production values. The combination of Ninja Theory’s expertise and Capcom’s unrivalled heritage in producing combat focused action titles will ensure that this latest addition to the over 11-million selling series will remain true to the Devil May Cry DNA so cherished by the fans, while bringing a new level of cinematic quality to the title.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Survive Limbo</strong> - The world of Limbo is a living and breathing entity, out to kill Dante.

<br />
Buzz Killer Weapon Pack<br />
Sledgehammer with barbed wire around the head and working buzz saws attached on each of its ends. Especially effective against big, armored enemies as it cuts easily through their plating. If you had trouble fighting the Demolishers, the Buzz Killer will now make short work of them.<br />

The Lacerator Weapon Pack<br />
An improvised weapon resembling a rake but definitely much more lethal. Its long sturdy shaft is crowned with a head of six shredded blades that cut deep into enemy flesh. With the Lacerator, you can make broad swings that will painfully wound multiple targets at once!<br />
<br />
The Constable Weapon Pack<br />
The Constable is a tough police baton wrapped in electrified barbed wire. As if that wasn’t enough, it’s tipped with a spiked head that generates plasma-like discharges – electrocuting those who dare come too close.<br />

The wars, famines and suffering of the last 20 millennia were to become a distant, fading memory, as scientific advances brought global peace and prosperity. Toward the end of the 20th century, a now forgotten US president even went so far as to officially proclaim the arrival of a New World Order, in which right, not might, would govern international relations. This bright future was not to be. First came a meltdown of the international stock and currency exchanges. Then the major international conglomerates were dissolved in a vain attempt to stop the fiscal hemorrhage. By 2012 the world economy had collapsed. Poverty and hunger caused social and political tensions to flare. As the crisis wore on, few were bold or naive enough to predict anything positive for the future. Most realized that the planet was on the verge of global conflict.<br><br>In 2048, the anticipated global conflict broke out with a violence that shook the planet to its core. All major centralized governments were destroyed in the maelstrom. Europe and Eastern Asia bore the brunt of the devastation, as entire urban centres, from Madrid to Moscow and from Seoul to Singapore were literally wiped off the map. <br>The human race has always been known for its resiliency. Within a dozen years, the Earth's inhabitants had begun to restore their old nationalities - with a few twists. Twelve states of the former United States joined together to form a new country, called the United Civilized States. The UCS citizens had essentially given up their old roles as producers and leaders. Nearly all work was being performed by robots which are controlled by expert computer systems. Not surprisingly, the human inhabitants of the UCS had become lazy and decadent.<br><br>The 20th-century dream for a better world had ended in death and destruction.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>EARTH 2150: THE MOON PROJECT</strong></h2>The year 2150 … one of the blackest chapters in the history of mankind.

Egyptian Senet (Ancient Egypt Game).<br />
The Mysterious Afterlife Journey And The Favorite Pastime Of The Pharaoh Tutankhamun.<br />
The Artifact Of The World's Oldest Board Game Found In King Tut's Tomb, Beside The Golden Coffin &amp; Sarcophagus.<br />
<br />
After performing opening of the mouth ceremony on your mummy by Anubis, you start your afterlife journey protected by Eye of Horus(Wadjet) to pass through the underworld realm of Osiris, challenging an invisible adversary inside an Egyptian hidden tomb in The Valley of the Queens located near the better known Valley of the Kings, on the west bank of the Nile river across from Thebes (Luxor).<br />
<br />
Senet is a board game from predynastic and ancient Egypt, it is the earliest known record of a backgammon , checkers, draughts, ludo and chess like games.<br />
<br />
The oldest hieroglyph representing a Senet game dates to around 3500 BC.The full name of the game in Egyptian was meaning &quot;The game of passing&quot;.<br />
<br />
Games have been around for thousands of years, but none are older than the ancient game of Senet, invented by the Egyptians roughly 3500 or 5000 years ago. It is believed that this two-player board game originated as a popular form of recreation with both royalty and peasantry. But by the mid-13th century BC, Senet had evolved into a more religious ritual. Some depictions from this time period forward show the game being played not by two people, but rather as a deceased player competing against an invisible adversary, interpreted by some to symbolize the deceased players own soul.<br />
<br />
The board has become a metaphor for the afterlife with pawns moving across the board just as a soul moves through layers of the netherworld after death. Reaching the final space and leaving the board is the goal of the game, just as reaching Horus and leaving the netherworld was the goal for the Egyptians after their death for attaining rebirth with the gods Isis &amp; Osiris, Sekhmet &amp; Bastet holding the Egyptian Ankh or the papyrus scepter.<br />
<br />
The game board consists of 30 squares or slots, arranged in 3 horizontal rows of 10. Pawns move from left to right through row 1, then drop down and move from right to left through row 2. Dropping down again, pawns move from left to right along row 3 and finally, off the board. The game uses the rules developed by Timothy Kendall in his 1978 work, Passing Through the Netherworld :The Meaning and Play of Senet, an Ancient Egyptian Funerary Game.<br />
<br />
The game includes five special squares, governed by their own rules, each containing a hieroglyphic. Square 15 is the House of Rebirth; square 26 is the House of Beauty; square 27 is the House of Water: square 28 is the House of the Three Truths; square 29 is the House of Two Truths; and square 30, the last, is the House of Horus, the Egyptian falcon-god and lord of the sky.<br />
<br />
Egyptian Senet is a pharaonic challenging game that combines luck,strategy,and magic features authentic photos of ancient Egyptian temples,plus artistically crafted graphics and animation of an ancient stone game board and pieces,set in an echoing,tomb-like chamber.Ritualistic music plus sound effects of stone pieces moving recreate the atmosphere of predynastic Egypt.The App's Icon shows the Egyptian Queen Nefertari playing Senet in her tomb,she was the great wife of the pharaoh Ramesses II(Ramses)Rio. Also many Egyptian Queens have a similar photos playing Senet such as Cleopatra,Nefertiti the great royal wife of Akhenaten,and the Queen Hatshepsut the wife of Thutmose II.<br />

For the first time in the Total War series, you will be able to intuitively command single ships or vast fleets upon seascapes rich with extraordinary water and weather effects that play a huge role in your eventual glorious success or ignominious defeat.

Real-time battles will pose new challenges with the addition of cannon and musket, challenging players to master new formations and tactics as a result of the increasing role of gunpowder within warfare. And the Campaign Map  for many, the heart of Total War  introduces a variety of new and upgraded elements, including new systems for Trade, Diplomacy and Espionage with agents; a refined and streamlined UI; improved Advisors; and a vastly extended scope, taking in the riches of India, the turbulence of Europe and, for the first time, the untapped potential of the United States of America.                    <br>					<ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Take command on the high seas.</strong> New real-time 3D naval warfare takes Total War's unparalleled battle action to the high seas, with players commanding single ships or vast fleets.                    <br>					</li><li><strong>Become a founding father.</strong> Starting in 1700  The era of warfare across oceans, revolution and the founding of the United States.                    <br>					</li><li><strong>All new graphics</strong> engine and technology features staggering real-time seascapes, new advanced landscape and flora systems, and dynamic weather.                    </li></ul><br><br>March 31, 2010 - Update <br>					Update 1.6 for Empire: Total War is available today.

5312e7a5-0459-4c75-9919-b1acfd0a5082,,"FIFA 15 brings football to life in stunning detail so fans can experience the emotion of the sport like never before. Witness the intensity of crowds chanting and cheering like on match day, and listen to commentators guide fans through the story of the game with Dynamic Match Presentation. For the first time ever, all 22 players on the pitch are connected with Emotional Intelligence - now players will react to opponents and teammates within the context, and relative to the narrative of the match. Next Generation Visuals put fans on Living Pitches with grass that wears and tears as the match progresses. Authentic Player Visuals make players lean, athletic, and true to their real-life appearance. Player Control heightens the responsiveness of player movement, gives athletes more control and personality on the ball, and makes Man-to-Man Battles more rewarding than ever before.  Football is the greatest drama on earth and FIFA 15 puts fans center stage, allowing them to feel the emotion and intensity of the world's greatest sport.
<br /><br />
<ul>
   <li><b>Emotional Intelligence</b> - For the first time ever, FIFA 15 models the emotions of all 22 players on the pitch, giving fans a chance to experience first-hand the attitudes and personalities of the world's best football players during a match. Players now recognize situations that trigger an emotional response and react naturally based on the game context. For example, a player that is being repeatedly fouled by an opponent could confront that opponent depending on the severity of the challenge and context of the competition. Players will respond authentically with new reactions to decisions, bad tackles, missed chances, goals, and other pivotal moments throughout the game. There are over 600 potential emotional reactions that could play out over the course of a game.  </li>
   <li><b>Dynamic Match Presentation</b> - Match Day will feel more dynamic and alive than ever before - immersing you in the match action and never taking you out of the moment. With region specific behaviors, crowds will now be distinguished by cheers and chants designated to their club, league, country, or continent. Fans at Anfield in Liverpool feel and act differently than the fans at La Bombonera in Buenos Aires. Commentators will mention specific fan behavior triggered by unique fan moments like the Poznan or club songs.  New Bench Reactions, 10 Player Goal Celebrations, ball boy animations, and contextual commentary will keep FIFA 15 fans engaged in the story of the match.</li>
   <li><b>Team Tactics</b> - Teams will now have contextual awareness of the game and will dynamically adjust their tactics according to the situation. For example, your opponent could be leading by a goal in the 88th minute and decide to hold the ball in the corner in an attempt to run down the clock. The end result is a more humanlike opponent that takes more risks when trailing, and potentially a more conservative approach when leading. Park the Bus, In the Mixer, and Time Wasting are just some of the Team Tactics fans will recognize in FIFA 15.  </li>
   <li><b>Authentic Player Visuals</b> - The FIFA 15 development team created the Next Generation football player - ensuring players appear true to their physical form. An all-new physically-based rendering lighting system changes the way players look, ensuring users are able to see a level of detail in players' faces which hasn't been possible before. New body rigging and character models make players feel powerful and athletic, while kits move realistically and react with the environment becoming dirty with mud and grass as the match unfolds.</li>
   <li><b>Living Pitch</b> - Pitches will never be the same. Slide tackles and boot marks are now visible on the pitch, and as the match progresses, the playing surface becomes increasingly weathered just as it would in a real football match. Fans playing in rain or wet weather will notice mud and debris on the pitch. Corner flag physics, goal frames that shake, and animated LED ad boards are just some of the new details that bring FIFA 15 to life.    </li>
   <li><b>Agility & Control</b> - FIFA 15 adds an all new level of responsiveness and control. Run Touch Dribbling allows players to better keep the ball under control in a sprint and in close-touch situations, giving personality to the most recognized players in the world. Leo Messi will dribble and move like he does in real life. Updated player biomechanics means that players will now react and move with balance and closer control when in possession of the ball. More precise steps and turns at low speed, and closer control at high speeds give fans more control and increased mobility when commanding players on the pitch.   </li>
   <li><b>Man-to-Man Battles</b> - Dispossessing your opponent in FIFA 15 is more rewarding and physical than ever before. Players use Full-Body Defending to win possession and keep it. Possession Tackles will reward great defending, helping players keep the ball close to their feet when a challenge is won. New shoulder barges, push/pull mechanics, and big fall physics allow fans to feel the battle; shirt pulling is also visible thanks to new character visuals and improved cloth technology.</li>
   <li><b>Correct Contacts</b> - Physically Correct Contacts revolutionizes the way the football interacts with the players and their environment. Every dribble, touch, pass, shot, and deflection moves corresponding to the spin of the ball in relation to the position of the body part or object that it connects with - this gives the football accurate spin, curl, and movement, as well as varied trajectories. The movement of the ball in FIFA 15 changes the game. </li>
   <li><b>Set Piece Control</b> - FIFA 15 fans now have more freedom in attack with the ability to take control of teammates during throw-ins, corners, and free kicks. Using the right stick, FIFA fans can now control teammates off the ball to put them in the optimal spot to receive a pass during dead ball situations. </li>

abc360ae-1e67-44d7-85cd-8c4c842cd11f,," FIFA MANAGER 13 that will be released this year is the 12th edition of the franchise, and focuses on the new Team Dynamics feature which makes your team come alive.<br /><br />

As a manager in FM13 you have complete control over the management of a modern football club. In the game you are responsible for the line-up, the tactics and training of your team, for signing the right players and the extension of your club facilities and the stadium. The special highlights in FM13 are the FIFA license, the FIFA 3D engine, more than 40,000 licensed players, many of whom come with original player pictures, the player manager and national team manager mode, the Create-a-Club mode and the Match Prognosis Tool as well as a unique, comprehensive editor.<br /><br />


   <ul>
   <li> Team Dynamics - FIFA MANAGER 13 comes alive with a team analysis feature called ""Team Matrix"", as well as a hierarchy pyramid, which allows you to visualize which players are facing challenges in the team pecking order. In the Team Dynamics section you get an overview of team hierarchy, rivalry, personality clashes, personal goals, family relationships and much more.</li>
   <li>    Your assistant manager helps you to analyse the team, and requesting a psychological profile of a player before signing him might help avoid future problems.</li>
   <li>    The new individual player objectives have a special role, and your team will be successful only with enough team leaders and everyone pulling in the same direction. From balancing player rivalries to spending enough time understanding and setting player expectations, FIFA MANAGER 13 will push you to perfect the art of team management.</li>
   <li>    Planning Tools - FIFA MANAGER 13 includes three new planning tools.</li>
   <li>    Squad Planner: This tool allows you to plan your squad for the next season. You can select current squad players, players in negotiations with your club and players who are just on your scouts' short list. It is then possible to try out various combinations to explore the impact they could have on your team and to directly start negotiations in case you want to really sign a player.</li>
   <li>    Upcoming Events: This screen lists all upcoming events and improvements; from dates of important matches to the completion date of the new stadium.</li>
   <li>    Player Development Tool: This tool allows predicting the career path of players depending on parameters like injuries, matches played, other positions, talent etc. It is an extremely helpful tool to make sure a player can really help the team long-term.</li>
   <li>    Half-Time - The new half-time feature gives you more control with detailed player speeches and new team speeches, options to boost the energy of a player by a massage or to offer players with minor knocks medical treatment, direct feedback on your decisions and the new Assistant option to delegate your work.</li>
   <li>    Player Objectives - Every player of the team has his personal objectives. Some want to become a first team regular, others want to play for their country, some simply want to improve their skills, whilst others want to be captain or take the penalties etc. The status of these objectives has a massive influence on the player's morale and as manager you must try your utmost to keep your players happy. You can now talk to a player to change his expectations or to give him new objectives. Also there are specific new talks for many situations, e.g. when you want the player to accept a loan deal or to move him to the reserves.</li>
   <li>    3D Match Improvements - The tactical settings now have more precise definition. There are no longer 3, 4, 5 or 6 settings, but you can essentially select probabilities for short versus long passing, the playing direction, the position of the defensive line, or the height of crosses. In particular crosses into the penalty area were improved and the headers become more realistic.</li>
   <li>    Numerous new fan banners in the stadiums create a more authentic atmosphere, and the fans now show their colours with shirts, scarves and jackets.</li>
   <li>    New Drag and Drop Quick Access Menu Bar - The new quick access menu bar allows you to select as many menu items as you like. You can then directly reach the relevant menu item with one mouse click. Every item also shows information whether you have already opened the respective screen on a particular day, and it also flags potential problems.</li>
   <li>    New Basic Screen Resolution - The new basic screen resolution of the game was increased from 1024x768 to 1280x1024. All screen resolutions from previous editions (minimum 1024x720, maximum 1920x1200) are of course also supported.</li>
   <li>    Numerous new fan banners in the stadiums create a more authentic atmosphere, and the fans now show their colours with shirts, scarves and jackets.</li>
   <li>    Live Ticker - In the Live Ticker the focus this year is on additional options for the manager to have direct influence on the game. The main feature is the new decision system to shout orders onto the pitch in more than 20 specific situations. Also FIFA MANAGER 13 includes the option to control the penalty taker and many additional comments on your tactical decisions. Last but not least the step-by-step text mode - which was very popular with the community in former versions of FIFA MANAGER - is reintroduced.</li>
   <li>    Your Feature! - Again the new edition of FIFA MANAGER includes many features suggested and selected by the community via a series of polls on our website. These features include ""Shooting Stars"" (with a particularly quick player development for a limited amount of time), the ""Buy-back Clause"", ""Local Scouting"" and ""Dynamic League Development"" (e.g. the television money changes in relation to the average league attendance and the clubs' international success).</li>

Also, 383 aircraft stationed on Oahu were destroyed and 2,323 American service men lost their lives that day. The Japanese only lost 29 aircraft duringtheir attack on Pearl Harbour.

3c24ace5-1b46-4ec5-a8a1-5a423ea0d869,"Football Manager 2014","- Play it whenever, wherever, however<br />
Play on Linux for the first time, plus the inclusion of ‘cloud-save’ technology which means that managers can now pursue a single career from any computer, anywhere in the world. FM14 also includes integration with Steam Workshop making it easy for managers to create and share customised FM content such as photo/logo packs, new and custom competitions and tailor-made challenges using the new Challenge Editor.<br />
<br />
- Improved Match Engine<br />
The 3D Match Engine has seen extensive improvements, including enhanced AI, improved lighting and player animation, individual player character and kit models, more realistic player reaction to on-field incidents and a range of optimisations which combine to make this the best looking and fastest FM Match Engine yet.<br />
<br />
- Tactical overhaul<br />
There has been a complete redesign of how tactics are created, selected and implemented with player roles and team strategies becoming even more prominent, definable roles for players for multiple positions, new player roles and instructions and improvements to rival managers' AI so that they’ll adapt their tactics more readily over time.<br />
<br />
- More realistic transfers and contracts<br />
FM 2014 features a revamped transfer module where opposing clubs and managers adopt a more realistic approach when making or responding to transfer offers. In addition, a number of new ‘real world’ transfer clauses have been added, such as the facility to loan a player back to the club he’s just been bought from and the option to offer a combination of cash and loan players, as well as new contract clauses such as a sub bench appearance fee. On top of this, the old ‘turn-based’ system of transfer negotiations can now be done two ways, the tried and tested system and a new ‘live’ system, similar to that used in FM’s contract negotiations.<br />
<br />
- More sophisticated board interaction<br />
Contract negotiations are more realistic in FM 2014, as managers and boards can now make demands and lay down their respective visions for the club in both initial job interviews and contract renewal discussions. Managers can also attempt to renegotiate transfer and wage budgets as a reward for staying loyal if they’ve been offered a job by another club, with the outcome helping aid their decision on whether to move or not.<br />
<br />
- Improved interaction with players, staff and media<br />
There is now better interaction between players, managers, their rivals and the media; for example, members of the coaching staff now offer feedback on how reserve and youth team players are performing. Managers can also ask key players to have a word with unhappy squad members, while the introduction of an end-of-season meeting allows the manager to let the squad know how they have performed and set targets for the coming season.<br />
<br />
- News system<br />
The news system has been overhauled so managers can now deal with many club matters directly from their inbox. In addition, news is now colour-coded, based on category, and contains more detail – for example, scout reports now appear as a single news item with a top-line report on all players scouted and the facility to shortlist or make an offer for each of these players.<br />
<br />
- Enhanced user interface<br />
Major changes have been made to FM 2014’s user interface. Key areas have been redesigned – including the training overview page, the transfer centre and the news homepage – while widespread changes have been made across the game’s user interface. The language employed throughout the game has also enjoyed a major overhaul and now corresponds more closely to the language of real world football.<br />
<br />
- Football Manager Classic evolved<br />
Managers can now choose more than three playable nations in Classic mode for a more immersive experience. In addition, FM’s ‘fast play’ mode now includes Transfer Deadline Day, a Match Plan wizard and new unlockables."

It’s a society survival game that asks what people are capable of when pushed to the brink of extinction. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city’s ruler has to manage both the citizens and the infrastructure they live in. The leader’s tactical skills face challenges that will frequently question morality and the basic foundations of what we consider organized society. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.<br><br>What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And...<br><br><strong>...who will you become in the process?</strong><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_frost.jpg?t=1525678989"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>THE CITY MUST SURVIVE</strong></h2>Frostpunk is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes with a cost. You face the task of <strong>building the last city on Earth</strong> and securing the means necessary <strong>for your people to survive.</strong><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>MAINTAIN HOPE</strong></h2>Survival is about hope and the will to live. Your ability to spark and maintain them both in your people will be a deciding factor in your success.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>MAKE THE LAW</strong></h2>Society is a group of people who abide by the same rules and share similar beliefs. Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES</strong></h2>Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. <strong>Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.</strong><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES </strong></h2>Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND </strong></h2>While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY </strong></h2>If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>GO BEYOND THE CAMPAIGN </strong></h2>The main story campaign can go different ways depending on your playstyle, but it is still not the only challenge to tackle. Frostpunk offers different scenarios and additional updates with new content will be added in the future.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_footer_2.jpg?t=1525678989"" >"

The economy makes it so that each choice impacts what options you have available to you later - will you build a shipyard first, or will you establish a Central Bank in order to boost your income early on? <br><br>Trading is critical in Crusade because you need to obtain and amass resources in order to do things. A “trade bar” now shows up above the dialogue box and shows how fair the trade is and how much further you’ll have to go before your trade partner accepts your proposal. Races will value resources differently based on how much money they have, whether they like you or not, and dozens of other factors. <br><br>The re-balancing done on the Alliances system will make you think twice about going back on your word or attacking certain civilizations. There are very real consequences for “war mongering” or for breaking an alliance or treaty - not only will the offended civilization come for blood, but now they’ll be bringing all their friends and allies, too.<br><br>Crusade also features a sleek, functional new UI. Multi-core pathfinding keeps turns short and quick, even in late games with dozens of civilizations on massive maps. Crusade is packed with new features and improvements that are both accessible to new fans and exciting for long-time players of Galactic Civilizations III."

0d565f63-3814-4967-9ac4-9bb5e8dc046f,Hurtworld,"WARNING: Hurtworld is still very early in development. It may be worth waiting until we are further through development before getting on board (We're not going anywhere). <br><br>Hurtworld is a hardcore multiplayer survival FPS with a focus on deep survival progression that doesn't become trivial once you establish some basic needs. That feeling when you're freezing to death trying to make a fire, or you're defenceless being chased by creatures. These experiences are what make a survival game. When you overcome that challenge and find a level of comfort it's a great feeling, but what do you do next?<br><br>Hurtworld tempts you out of your comfort zone with rich resources, better loot and higher tech. It will also throw more dangerous creatures, harsher environments and new challenges at you that can't be taken on without the proper gear or refined skill. Will you settle for bows and arrows and a campfire, or push deeper into the map and start scavenging for vehicle parts and better weapons?<br><br>Built from the ground up with solid multiplayer foundations. Designed for fast skill based PVP and PVE. You will constantly have to decide which is the biggest threat, the player opposite you or the creatures that will hear your gunshot.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Current Features</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Crafting Gear, Tools, Weapons and Machines</strong> - Combine what you find in the world to make hundreds of different items.<br></li><li><strong>Structure Building</strong> - Claim land solo or with friends, build from a hut to a city using our attachment point based structure system.<br></li><li><strong>Procedurally Generated, Customizable Vehicles</strong> - Find a car or quad bike wreck in world with random panels. Scavenge for parts and get it moving again. Find rare paint colors and skin patterns to get it looking just the way you want. Upgrade your engine and gearbox. Make sure to carry a spare tire!<br></li><li><strong>Mining Resources</strong> - Heaps of different minable resources that require different tools to gather, from Pickaxes to Dynamite. Alternatively you can build some automated drills and let them do the work for you.<br></li><li><strong>Twitch based PVP</strong> - Some areas of the map will be highly contested, are you willing to share the limited resources needed to survive? If you aren't, we have many different projectile and melee weapons to do away with your opponent. Careful though, murdering your peers may increase your own penalty for death.<br></li><li><strong>Farmable Plants</strong> - Find wild seeds and get a crop going back home.<br></li><li><strong>Hunting Neutral and Hostile Animals</strong> - Environment is <strong>filled</strong> with animals, they may be your lunch, you may be theirs.<br></li><li><strong>Town Ruins and Relics with Random Loot</strong> - Tightly contested, if the radiation and mutated creatures don't kill you, another player will. You might just find those engine parts you've been looking for here.<br></li><li><strong>Dynamic Day/Night + Weather</strong> - Pick the right time of day to attempt crossing sand dunes, but watch out for sandstorms.<br></li><li><strong>Stat Simulation</strong> - More than just a hunger bar, everything in the world is affected by time of day, current biome, localized effects like radiation, dynamic weather, heat given off by machines etc. Items can have different behaviors based on current stats too. That steak in your backpack might just freeze in the snow, at least it will take longer to go rotten. Put that storage chest too close to your fire you may come home to a pile of Ash.<br></li><li><strong>Drastically Different Biomes</strong> - Explore the harsh world. From the snow forests of the North to the colorful parrot Tokars of the red desert, gear that lets you survive in one biome may kill you in another. Players with a home base advantage will likely be better equipped to handle their surroundings than invaders.</li></ul><br>All the features above are currently in the game and functional, however much of the content in these systems is placeholder. While we've done a lot of the hard work developing robust systems to underpin gameplay mechanics, we haven't yet spent a lot of time generating and balancing content for these systems. As this is mostly configuration work, we will be able to quickly deliver lots of new content in the coming months.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Server Authoritative Multiplayer</h2>Most multiplayer open world games use a MMO style network architecture. While this allows for greater player numbers per server, it opens up the game up to endless cheating exploits that are impossible to stomp out. Hurtworld uses an architecture closer to that of a modern FPS, where all physics and game logic are calculated on the server. While cheats can never be fully stopped, this structure makes a large amount of the exploits impossible from day one. Due to this, our servers will use a bit more resources for the same number of people than your usual survival game, but we think it's totally worth it.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Performance</h2>Keeping your FPS high and smooth is crucially important to us. As members of the PC master race we know 60+ FPS is a right, not a privilege. Not to mention PVP gunplay just doesn't work at low FPS. This is an ongoing battle while we are developing the game, adding new stuff slows things down, doing an optimization pass gives us some breathing room. It goes in cycles. <br><br><br>Currently things are running very well, we did a <strong>lot</strong> of hard work during our closed alpha to bring performance up and to get rid of big spikes. On mid range 2 year old machines we're currently getting 80+ FPS on medium settings. Our biggest bottleneck is player skinning on the CPU. Meaning if your CPU is a potato, and there are lots of players in your area, it will chugg. We have a fairly comprehensive graphical settings menu that should let you scale things down even on lower spec machines. We are constantly working to improve performance and we'll do our best to keep everything running well throughout early access.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">PVP &amp; Gunplay</h2>Hurtworld has competitive FPS in its DNA. Violence isn't the only option, but when it's needed you want to be sure it's a fair skill rewarding system. We are keeping the gear cap low on PVP items. This means a player with 150 hours in a server and endgame loot can't faceroll their way around the map with impunity. Higher grade gear will allow you to survive in harsher environments and take on fiercer creatures, it won't however stop a bullet to the face.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Infamy System</h2>We are currently testing a new system that changes the way gear is dropped on death. By default all gear you have equipped like tools guns and clothes won't drop on death. <br><br>Secured gear in your hotbar and equipment slots (gear you are wearing) can only be dropped if your infamy level is above zero.<br><br>Infamy is a stat bar that increases by one every time you kill someone, and slowly decreases over time back to zero. For each point of infamy you currently have, you have a chance to lose a secured item (equipped gear / weapons / tools).<br><br>We hope this will have a few effects.<br> <br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Most people will actually use their best gear all the time<br></li><li>New spawns being harassed at spawn that can’t fight back won’t lose much<br></li><li>Players harassing fresh spawns are putting a target on their own head, as some of their gear is now up for grabs to anyone who kills them, creating interesting skirmishes.<br></li><li>Farming yield of a player will be dependant on the territory they can control. If a player tries to mine the limited resources around your base, you can kill them to claim the resources back without completely ruining their day.<br></li><li>We can make tiers of gear much more expensive to create without crossing the too valuable to lose bracket</li></ul><br>As with any new gameplay system, it sounds great in theory to us, how it plays will be the real test. This behavior is currently enabled by default, however server owners can override <i>playerlootmode</i> to 4 different settings depending on preference including the classic lose everything.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Modding</h2><br>Modding is one of our top priorities. We have been working with the awesome guys at Oxide, to integrate their modding framework with Hurtworld. You can download their API right now and start writing server mods for Hurtworld in Lua, C#, Javascript or Python!<br><br>In the future we want to build Hurtworld into a platform for different sandbox game types (Think Dota 2 custom games). We are designing the game we want to play most, however the framework of player movement, gear, combat, environmental effects, AI, vehicles, construction and gathering can all be applied to vastly different game modes with very little work. We are slowly building up a more powerful SDK we plan to release sometime in 2016. I can't wait to see what other people do with a solid FPS framework with the backing of a fleshed out survival game.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">FAQ</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Will you add procedural maps?<br>Currently we are focusing on hand crafted maps. We are a good way through developing an SDK for Unity we call &quot;Shigi Tools&quot; designed to allow the community to create their own maps in-engine. It's not out of the realm of possibility that a server will have its own unique map designed by its admins that is downloaded on connection. This combined with server side mods should open up the gameplay possibilities a lot. We don't have an ETA on this yet, we are using it to build internal maps but it will require some new engine systems to handle runtime loading that we will prioritize amongst other things.<br><br></li><li>Can I host a server?<br>Yes! We have a Windows and Linux headless server build that can be downloaded through the tools section of Steam or via SteamCMD, check out the Hurtworld Wiki for guides.<br><br></li><li>How many players per server?<br>We are optimizing for 50. We run all our physics on the server with low jitter and a high tickrate. This means we won't reach the 200+ mmo class of servers, however we think the tradeoff is worth it for a more responsive experience and a game more resistant to cheats. It also means we can do more interesting things with AI that feel more like Left for Dead and less like World of Warcraft.<br><br>MAC USERS NOTE: If you get a crash on startup of the game, please disable Steam overlay</li></ul>"

Through complex, real-time character progression and RPG system, over a hundred abilities to learn and upgrade, dozens of weapons and enhancers, thousands of Infected, over twenty mutations, tens of NPCs and teammates, within a twenty-plus hour long story campaign, ISR offers plenty for everybody. <br><br>I Shall Remain is a Post Apocalyptic Action Role-Playing game with survival aspects. Set in an alternate history at the end of the Second World War, when Nazis managed to release a deadly virus over US territory, the game tells the story of two brothers and their intricate relation with the apocalyptic world that emerges in the wake of the disastrous Z0M81 pandemic.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/293460/extras/Zombie07242014_201417820.jpg?t=1478190326"" ><br><br>Discover the truth about the infection and decide the future of the human race. Experience the story-driven, immersive gameplay enhanced by a dynamic real-time day-night system and the mood affecting weather system. You get to share your journey with as many as 7 other AI controlled teammates, each with their own story to tell, encounter multiple NPCs, traders and trainers and thousands Infected that you'll have to battle using over 30 weapons, from baseball bats to automatic machine guns and flame throwers and, from time to time, even tanks.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/293460/extras/Beta_600.png?t=1478190326"" ><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/293460/extras/ttl_action.png?t=1478190326"" ><br><br><i><strong><u>Weapons</u></strong></i> - The weapons in I Shall Remain are grouped in categories. We have melee weapons (knives, baseball bats, planks, crowbars), small weapons (pistols, submachie guns), rifles (shotguns, different kinds of rifles) and heavy ones (heavy machine guns, flamethrower, bazooka). The total number of weapons is over 30 with each weapon having at least 4 levels of configuration each level giving you different effects the weapon can have over the enemies and yourself when used or equipped. Ammo can as well be imbued with serum for additional damage.<br><br><i><strong><u>Throwables</u></strong></i> - Aside weapons the player can throw grenades and plant mines for infected to step on and explode.<br><br><i><strong><u>Pickables and explosives</u></strong></i> - The player can also pickup certain objects like barrels, crates and even other NPCs to carry and help. Some of the objects while not necessarily pick-able (some barrels are both packable and explosive) can be shot and they will explode allowing you to kill lots of infected without using resources. while others can be used to barricade yourself in small confined spaces.<br><br><i><strong><u>Controllables</u></strong></i> - From time to time the game offers the player the possibility to enter tanks or other vehicles and use their weapons to defend himself or a larger area. Is up to the player to decide whether to use them or not and for how long.<br><br><i><u><strong>Buildings</strong></u></i> - Many unique buildings throughout the city to explore, each you can use differently, find cover in or loot. There's a level of risk associated with entering an unknown building as well so you should be careful when doing so.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/293460/extras/Zombie07252014_065508980.jpg?t=1478190326"" ><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/293460/extras/ttl_roleplaying.png?t=1478190326"" ><br><br><i><u><strong>Character progression</strong></u></i> - In I Shall Remain the player gains experience as a result of taking actions. Each action in game, whether is shooting a monster, repairing a weapon or simply running will award the player with experience points in attributes and skills. The way you play the game will define what kind of character you are.<br><br><i><u><strong>Doctrines</strong></u></i> - In I Shall Remain doctrines enable your character to improve your attributes and skills or give you new abilities. Each doctrine could be upgraded each upgrade increasing doctrine’s effects or even add new ones. Currently there are up to 128 doctrines in the game.<br><br><i><u><strong>Economy</strong></u></i> - Serum is the center pylon of the game economy system and the exchange currency. Within the game there are various traders that you can interact with by selling or buying items such as weapons, doctrines, medical kits, water, ammunition, scraps, ammo and lantern batteries. Certain traders will also offer you special kind of services (buy ammo, increase your skills level or advance skill ranks).<br><br><i><u><strong>Quests</strong></u></i> - Like mostly everything in I Shall Remain, quests tend to resemble real-life scenarios thus everything is in to serve the purpose of the world and the story. That being said, most quests in I Shall Remain are story related but perhaps as much as 50% don’t relate to the main story branch. That's why, defining detailed side quests and stories became an important tool for us to allow the player to immerse himself into the game world and make it more believable.<br><br><i><u><strong>Dialogs</strong></u></i> - The Discussion/dialog system in I Shall Remain is fully dependent on your choice thus drastically shaping the way your experience develops. Whole side story branches might never be touched if the player chooses not to.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/293460/extras/Zombie07242014_201827588.jpg?t=1478190326"" ><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/293460/extras/ttl_survival.png?t=1478190326"" ><br><br><i><u><strong>Infection</strong></u></i> - The Virus is actually the main villain in the game. Everything happens because of it and you will have to deal with it on a daily basis. You cannot cure it but you can always reduce it so it won’t affect your skills and your character performance. For that not to happen though, you will always need to have a steady flow of Serum.<br><br><i><u><strong>Tiredness</strong></u></i> - Tiredness determines how much fatigue your character gathered, increased levels of tiredness affecting your health and stamina regeneration rate as well as your chances of aiming correctly. Make sure you always take time to regularly rest inside a building out of any outside influence the weather being the main factor for it.<br><br><i><u><strong>Scavenging</strong></u></i> - Throughout the game there are hundreds of places you can scavenge for resources, you just have to find those places and take the time to actually run the scavenge operation.<br><br><i><u><strong>Repairing</strong></u></i> - Every weapon in the game has a wearing off factor which determines how much you can actually use it until it breaks. There’s multiple ways of repairing your weapon, from doing it yourself using scraps or breaking other weapons to having a teammate do it for you or just get it to an NPC somewhere in the city to repair it.<br><br><i><u><strong>Teaming up</strong></u></i> - There are as many as 7 special Teammates you can take with you in your journey. Playing alone is always fun and rewarding but playing with teammates will give you a different experience altogether. Manage them, give them weapons, increase their stats and choose their path. Is all up to you on what kind of team you will lead.<br><br><i><u><strong>Senses</strong></u></i> - There's a certain threshold under which each infected type will not sense you. Walking will make you silent, using melee weapons instead of shooting ones will do it as well.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/293460/extras/Zombie07252014_065105310.jpg?t=1478190326"" >"

a963c67d-e1b9-4978-815b-d1d89532961b,,"Oleg Maddox’s world famous IL-2 Sturmovik series of flight simulators continues to expand. The latest offering, IL-2 1946, adds 36 new planes, four new gigantic maps, over a hundred new ground objects, and nearly 200 new campaign missions. This new opus also includes all of the previous Il-2 series content. What years ago began as a one-aircraft study sim is now an astonishing anthology, with a whopping 229 flyable aircraft and over 300 aircraft total! Not to mention that players will have the opportunity to get a first glance at the future of the series arriving next year: Storm of War Battle of Britain via exclusive bonus videos.<br><br>

<ul>
<li>New Aircraft: – 32 new flyable fighters and bombers, and four new AI aircraft! </li>
<li>Over the Russian Front, the player will gain access to six new versions of the Petlyakov Pe-2, the most famous Soviet level and dive bomber of the war. </li>
<li>In the Far East and the Pacific, players will finally fly the long-awaited one true heir to the series namesake, the Il-10 Sturmovik. Other new planes range from the Ki-27 Nate, the plane that fought against the Flying Tigers in 1941, to the N1K2 George and J2M5 Jack, the two most advanced Japanese fighters of WWII. </li>
<li>And finally, the player will fly over a dozen new jet and rocket aircraft such as the MiG-9 jet fighter, the predecessor to the famous MiG-15 that gained world-wide fame in the Korean War; the Ta-183, a jet fighter designed by Kurt Tank, the creator of the famous FW-190, and the Arado Ar-234 Blitz, the world’s first operation jet bomber.</li>
<li>New Maps: Large new historical maps of the Kiev region; a map of Manchuria focusing on a border region between USSR, China and Japanese-occupied Korea; a large bonus Burma map; and an online Khalkin Gol / Nomonhan map. </li>


<li>New Campaigns: Nine new campaigns with nearly 200 missions add incredible realism and attention to detail. There are detailed careers for fighter and bomber pilots, for the German, Soviet, and Japanese air forces, offering such varied objectives as flying jet bombers over occupied Europe, to intercepting American B-29 Super fortresses over Iwo Jima and Japanese home islands! As opposed to dynamically generated campaigns that shipped with our previous offerings, the new missions are all hand-made, giving the player much more detailed environments, and much more exciting missions.</li>


<li>Alternate History: Three of the nine campaigns are a departure into alternate history, focusing on hypothetical battles between the Soviet Union and Germany in the year 1946, while WWII still rages on. Both the VVS and Luftwaffe now have access to advanced jet and rocket fighters, and other revolutionary technology. All of these new planes are modeled with the same incredible degree of historical accuracy and attention to detail as all the other planes in Il-2.</li>


<li>New Features: With the alternate history campaigns, the player will gain access to such exotic equipment as Soviet mixed-power fighters, using both piston and rocket engines; fly incredible jet aircraft capable of sub-sonic speeds; and launch wire-guided air-to-air rockets at enemy bomber formations. 1946 also adds an incredible variety of new ground targets, including, for the first time in the series, trenches and bunkers that give a whole new dimension to the ground attack aspect of the sim.</li>


<li>Nearly 1,000 new Paint schemes: The new planes, as well as many of the other ones in the series, come with a host of historical paint schemes, showing many of the individual aircraft or squadrons that served in WWII. </li>


<li>Detailed Plane Guide: A detailed document, totaling over 450 pages of information, gives the low-down on every single one of our 229 flyable aircraft, allowing new players much easier access to the incredible variety of aircraft in the sim. </li>


<li>Exclusive Bonus: Making of, interview videos and screenshots of the new features, plus exclusive screenshots and never before seen videos taken from the next Maddox game: Storm of War: Battle of Britain. Those videos will highlight some of the great improvements you will enjoy end of next year. Plus screenshots of the team behind this game. The previous games of the brand are also included in the bonus: IL-2 Forgotten Battles: Ace Expansion Pack and Pacific Fighters.</li>

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.<br><br><i>Firefight</i> --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish</i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br><br><i>Occupy</i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or &quot;tug of war&quot;.<br><br><i>Ambush</i> --- A high value target (&quot;HVT&quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.<br><br><i>Strike</i> --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.<br><br><i>Infiltrate</i> --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.<br><br><i>Flashpoint</i> --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.<br><br><i>Elimination</i> --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Cooperative Game Modes</h2><br><i>Checkpoint</i> --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.<br><br><i>Hunt</i> --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life.<br><br><i>Survival</i> --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.<br><br><i>Outpost</i> --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates.<br><br><i>Conquer</i> --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers."

The population is being terrorized by a reckless army; in the meantime the main export goods are drugs. Subversion and fraudulence has infiltrated all levels of local government and the ever-present Mafia has his fingers in many pies. You are working undercover on behalf of the US government and your goal is to destroy the mighty drug cartel. You'll need a skilled hand to put together the right team of mercenaries and the negotiating skills of a diplomat to get the sceptical population on to your side.

Your objectives are - to hire a core group of skilled professionals through A.I.M., the Association of International Mercenaries; to win the local population over to your side by displaying courage and loyalty; to train your men around the clock and then send them into dangerous missions and lethal fire fights and to conquer the depths of underground mines, reap their riches and discover their secrets. Each success will bring you closer to total victory, while each failure must be overcome with iron determination. Sometimes a tactical withdrawal can bring you more benefits than a battle for battle's sake. Retreat from one sector only to surprise the enemy by attacking on another flank. At the beginning, some of your enemy's bases may seem to be impregnable - but don't despair - you will have to become stronger step by step and slowly gain ground.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>FEATURES:</strong></h2><strong>Only the best of strategy</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Incomparable depth of gaming combined with a non-linear gameplay<br></li><li>A unique mixture of real time reconnaissance and turn based combat <br></li><li>You influence the smallest details of every tactical move</li></ul><br><strong>and role-play</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Create your own optimal mercenary. <br></li><li>Interact with more than 150 characters.  <br></li><li>Recruit teams of mercenaries all with their own unique personality. <br></li><li>The likes and dislikes of mercenaries between themselves influence the motivation and skill of a team. <br></li><li>Mercenaries have an excellent memory for the behavior of the gamer: Good and bad experiences have their own effect on the players game. <br></li><li>Three difficulty levels.</li></ul><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">NEW IN WILDFIRE:</h2></strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Up to 10 mercenaries in a team<br></li><li>8 new playable mercenaries with individual histories <br></li><li>230 new and reworked sectors: new settlements, increased building density <br></li><li>Varying landscapes with changing density of vegetation and new visual conditions in close combat.<br></li><li>All weapons and explosives have been newly balanced with absolutely authentic characteristics - Total realism in the combination of weapons and protection systems.<br></li><li>Realistic sound effects for a new, exciting and authentic game feeling <br></li><li>More than 20 new weapons: USP, Uzi, UMP, MP5A3, Mini-30, HK33, G36, MP7, MSG90, AN-94, RPK, V-94, VAL, VSS and over 150 new objects.<br></li><li>There are new opponents and unfortunately for the player they have become a lot tougher, cleverer and unscrupulous.

												<p>Our swashbuckling sausage-dog star is Gaius James Rover, son of the famous clown Jolly Rover, who died from a blow to the groin from an improperly loaded joke cannon.</p>
												<p>Following the tragically comedic death of his father, young Gaius, who insists on using his middle name James, goes to live with his uncle, a wealthy plantation owner on a small Caribbean island. While practising a particularly tricky juggling move, he accidentally taints a barrel of rum with tobacco, creating a potent and addictive brew which he coins ‘Jolly Rover’, one of the most prized substances in the Caribbean.</p>
												<p>Alas, the wealth of Jolly Rover sales only manages to fill the pockets of his uncle, and Gaius longs for action and adventure and, more importantly, the opportunity to start his own circus and follow in the footsteps of his father.</p>
												<p>It is not long before the fumbled juggling ball of opportunity raps Gaius smartly on the head yet again. While his uncle is away, a large contract for Jolly Rover arrives from Guy DeSilver, Governor of the notorious Groggy Island, with payment upfront!</p>
												<p>In a blinding flurry of optimism, Gaius pools his meagre savings with this advance and charters a ship and crew to take him to Groggy Island. Along the way he meets a colourful band of seafaring cutthroats, scallywags and rogues otherwise known as pirates.</p>
												<p>It is here we begin to follow the short and stubby tail of Gaius across three wild and untamed tropical islands, as he attempts to fulfil his dream of starting a circus, hampered only by pirates, villains, voodoo, love and considerable lack of loot.</p>
												<p>Jolly Rover is a traditional 2D point and click adventure, including casual elements, such as an integrated hint system, and task bar. Bonus elements include unlockable Captain Bio's, music, concept art and developer commentary!</p>

The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. <br><br></li><li><strong>Custom design as many characters as you want </strong>and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. <br><br></li><li><strong>Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre.</strong> No &quot;hero&quot; characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. <br><br></li><li><strong>You are not the chosen one. </strong>You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.<br><br></li><li><strong>Build a base</strong> where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. <br><br></li><li><strong>Purchase and upgrade your own buildings</strong> to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. <br><br></li><li><strong>Variation and possibilities of gameplay. </strong>Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. <br><br></li><li><strong>Dynamic, ever changing world. </strong>Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a &quot;game&quot;, you are living and surviving in a simulated world.<br><br></li><li><strong>Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive</strong>, or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. <br><br></li><li><strong>Absolutely no Level-scaling.</strong> The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. <br><br></li><li><strong>Realistic medical system that affects gameplay.</strong> A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. <br><br></li><li><strong>Intelligent AI</strong> that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. <br><br></li><li><strong>Aid or oppose the various factions</strong> in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. <br><br></li><li><strong>Independently developed </strong>with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. <br><br></li><li><strong>Original game world. </strong>There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches.

The game came out on PC late last year and has provided hundreds of thousands of people with a solid way to spend some time in a faraway fantasy land, exploring, discovering and surviving. So, you know… a fun game!</p><br><h1>What is the game about?</h1><p>Good question! One approach to it would we to try to compile some sort of feature list, but what does that really tell you. Another way to address this question is to talk about the emotional journey and experience that Kingdom: New Lands offers.<br><br>It is about exploration, discovery, survival and that awesome feeling that you get, when you figure something out, on your own. When multiple pieces all of a sudden come together to form a whole – a basis for a new strategy or an understanding how something in the world of Kingdom: New Lands truly works.<br><br>It is about tenacity and overcoming obstacles – even when they seem to be unsurmountable. Pulling through, against all odds. Rebuilding and recovering. And that huge internal high-five when you succeed. <br><br>It is about figuring out how best to manage your little Kingdom and tie everything together in a fashion where the game doesn’t play you – you play the game.<br><br>It’s also beautiful, tranquil, melancholy, frantic, stressful and wonderful. It delivers a spectrum of emotions that combine into a unique experience.<br><br>It's a minimalist strategy game where you need to discover the rules of how the world behaves before you can rule effectively. It's also a little bit whimsical, it's pretty, and it can be frustrating but it won't hold your hand.</p><br><h1>But what’s new?</h1><p>Kingdom: New Lands introduces a lot of new things and builds on the original Kingdom game. It changes the end game significantly. It’s loaded with new elements, new things to discover and explore. It meets a lot of requests for new features, suggested improvements and general feedback from the incredible and wonderful community that has embraced the world of Kingdom and stuck with the game since the launch of the original title – and even further back, when the earliest iteration of Kingdom was a Flash based browser game, enjoyed by an incredible number of people.<br><br>So, for anyone that has played Kingdom before, Kingdom: New Lands will introduce many new elements that revitalize the experience. New players will find a bigger, deeper world than the original Kingdom (now called Kingdom: Classic) had to offer.<br><br>We hope you try out the game and enjoy playing it, as much as we’ve enjoyed getting it into your hands.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/496300/extras/sticker_archer_shooting-cropped.png?t=1525287423"" ><br>Tales spread of far off isles with mysteries waiting to be discovered.

In this world, he was a strong and dour man, who had seen much of the world and partook in his fair share of sins. None will dare to guess what awaits him in the next world. Through the many festivities he participated in he never seemed to revel in them. His eyes held a heaviness only matched by the weight of his flail. Some joked that this heaviness suggested the man had passed through Iron Forest. And at times it was hard to say, whether they were jokes at all.<br />
<br />
The tale begins with a death, but it will not be last before the story’s conclusion.<br />
<br />
Gustav’s estate was divided in accordance with his will. Felsen Castle and the adjoining villages passed into your brother’s ownership. Other relatives partitioned the estate of Ludahof, the land and a fortune worth several thousand guldens. You, however, inherited just a sword and a small casket. You opened the latter to find two objects.<br />
<br />
The one was a metal oak leaf similar in size to a real one. At first it seemed a decoration to you but you knew the difference between silver and steel. The edge pierced your hand and you wondered who would make a decoration that could wound? Curious, you scrutinized the leaf closer. The veins were were so thin, its folds and imperfections so true to life. The spots and the play of shading was unlike any engraving you had ever seen that there was no doubt in your mind that this was not made by a human hand…<br />
<br />
The other object inside the casket was a map."

I'll tell you why:<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/680400/extras/steam_pc_storeIntro_features.png?t=1518689588"" ><br><br><strong>--How long does it take to beat the game? Half an hour?</strong><br><br>C'mon, what can you do within 30 minutes in this game, maybe clear the first chapter? That's only 1/8 of all the levels, and pretty much the easiest part!<br><br><strong>--So you mean you'll keep doing the laser cat trick for 4 hours?</strong><br><br>No kidding! Light Tracer has 8 chapters with TOTALLY DIFFERNT gameplay and machanics and puzzles! Could you please check the reviews from media? Here are some examples.<br><br><i>Light Tracer is a well-crafted VR platform title. Once you get used to the controls, it becomes challenging enough to keep you coming back for more  --VRFocus</i><br><br><i>Light Tracer is a wonderful, if at times way too tough VR experience. It looks and sounds great, and will keep players busy for a very long time.  --PXS-Sense.nl</i><br><br><i>It’s a lot of “pat your head and rub your stomach” level complexity as my brain tried to sync up two distinctly separate things in order to help the princess on her journey, especially the further up the tower I climbed. -- PlayStation Lifestyle</i><br><br>See? This game is challenging!<br><br><strong>--But what about that best kids and family game award?</strong><br><br>They are probably wrong, because if you let a kid play the latter levels they will probably cry and quit -- I don't think they can figure out the puzzles or even the action part. If there has to be an award for Light Tracer, it should be &quot;Most hardcore VR game&quot; or something.<br><strong><br>--Hardcore??? Are you serious??? With this chibi character?</strong><br><br>Don't be fooled by the visualization! It's cute, no problem, but it's not an &quot;easy-come-and-go&quot; thing! There are boss fights for each chapter and it feels like the battles in Legend of Zelda! It involves action, puzzle-solving and patience, which is just what a hardcore game means!<br><br><strong>--OK, OK, I get it, it's Legend of Zelda in VR?</strong><br><br>Sorry but you are wrong again! It's not ripping off Zelda, instead, everything here you will see is original. Just, the developers try to mix some classic feel of Mario, Legend of Zelda, and Monument Valley into VR, with their original control scheme. But you should soon see that this make the game feel even different from those classic games when you play it in VR! Honestly I don't know how to explain it well and that's the reason why there's so much misunderstanding to it. But from what everyone says after playing it, it's a game that any curious person shouldn't miss.<br><strong><br>--Anything more?</strong><br>Yes, Light Tracer is on Steam now and if you want to check if we are wrong just try it!"

Snowblind Studios is in the unique position of drawing inspiration from both the literary and film rights to world of Middle-earth, allowing players to bloody their axes on a wide range of deadly enemies and traverse both established and never-before-seen locations. The result is a journey that is both epic and intimate, familiar yet unexpected.

						<h2>Key Features:</h2>
						<ul>
						<li><strong>Action Meets RPG</strong> - Intense, visceral, and satisfying combat. Rich, layered, and impactful character progression. In War in the North, you get both. Find and equip the best loot, upgrade your hero using a wide range of skills and items, and feel the intense satisfaction of rushing into real-time battles with friends by your side. Fight through the brutal realities of the war on all fronts that were brought to life in the lore. Immerse yourself and make your own mark on Middle-earth.
						<li><strong>Co-op at its Core</strong> - Build your own fellowship of three heroes to confront the growing army in the North. The survival of your group and all of Middle-earth depends upon your uniquely skilled heroes working together. You must fight together or you will die alone, and these high stakes make the experience of playing together both socially engaging and incredibly satisfying. The first time you rescue a friend who has been grabbed by a troll and is desperately yelling for help, you will understand what we mean.
						<li><strong>An Untold Story</strong> - While much attention and focus has been placed on the journey of the One Ring, the assault on Middle-earth hits all corners of the map. War in the North turns our attention towards an integral part of the storyline that is grounded in details within the books and various appendices. This is not someone else’s fight. This is your own effort to forage a way through the dark, dangerous, and unknown landscape, defending all that is yours. This is your war.

9731ff91-d8ee-4893-ad16-b682b57fb45b,Miscreated,"<strong>This is an early ALPHA release of MISCREATED. The current feature set is limited, but will be increased as development continues. You will experience issues during gameplay - incomplete features, bugs, game crashes, performance issues, and even complete character wipes.</strong><br><br>Nobody knows what started the Final War — it was over too fast, fought with the last of the belligerent nations’ nuclear stockpiles, and the ones who pulled the triggers didn’t survive. It was the Final War because after that there was really nobody left who wanted to fight; we were all too busy surviving. Half a century of wars using nukes, bioweapons, nanoweapons, and even kinetic-kill weapons, gave us the Empty World: population 100 million and falling fast.<br> <br>Who’s to blame? Depends on who you are, but you could just as easily blame the weapons industry; by the end, virtually every arms dealer in the world was owned by Amalgamated Corporation; while everyone was fighting they’d been buying up what Karl Marx used to call “the means of production,” and in the end missiles on both sides proudly wore the AC label.<br> <br>Hell, in the end AC made just about everything, AC Sportsdrinks, AC Icecream, AC Battlegear, even AC Happytabs. I miss those. AC even gave us our wonderful mutant problem; the “vaccine” they developed when radiation sickness became as common as seasonal pneumonia from all those dirty battlefields — all the weapons-grade isotopes getting into the water table, or the fish, or the air — reacted with some of the leftover bioweapons and made lots of people go as squirrely as tab-pumped cannibals. You can ignore a neighbor developing neo-elephantitis or novuleprosy, but when he tries to eat you, you’ve got to take an interest.<br> <br>So that’s it, we’re done, civilization is taking a breather. In 2089, anyone left alive and unmutated is just focused on staying that way. There are stories of enclaves here and there, where they’re lucky enough to have plenty of food stockpiled and mutants are thin on the ground or there’s lots of ammunition to throw at them. My advice is find one. Or make one. The Earth abides, all this too shall pass away, and if Darwin blesses you then you or your kids will inherit what’s left. For now, it’s one day at a time.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Current Features in the Early Access Release</h2><br><strong>Only a portion of the current map is available to play on.

Long before “Metroidvania” was a thing, we fell in love with the original Castlevania series, as well as with other Hall of Famers such as the Metroid, Contra, and Ninja Gaiden games. About halfway through the lifecycle of the first-generation PlayStation, sprite-based game development took an unfortunate nosedive, and the sorts of games we loved most and grew up with just weren't being made as frequently or, frankly, with as much love and care as they once were.<br><br>Indie game development really helped to reinvigorate both the sprite-based action-platformer genre and the magic of actual sprite animation. rdein's games combine what we’ve always loved about tight-action 2D gaming with splendid influences from more modern games like Dark Souls. The dedication to your actions necessitated by animation locks; the insane intensity driving the boss fights and how epic it is that this quaint little heroine can tackle these heroic endeavors; the attention to detail in the environments, designs, and animations... all of this stuff is simply stunning and rdein pulls it off to beautiful effect.<br><br>Then there’s also the story itself, which is also a masterpiece in game storytelling: a strange, mysterious world that you inhabit with countless hopeless souls whom you are trying to save. There is painstaking detail in every item, every snippet of dialogue. You find yourself constantly readjusting how you feel about these people. You're trying to save them, but do they even want to be saved? Or should you be more worried about that awkwardly sinister tone in their voices...?<br><br>Momodora: RUTM shouldn’t exactly be categorized as “Metroidvania” or “Souls-like”, but there certainly are elements of both contained within. It's a game of its own, and it’s one of the best entries in the mind-bogglingly expansive genre of side-scrolling action-platformers. We at Playism all love the game, and we can state with absolute confidence that if you’ve bothered to read this far, then you certainly will, too."

The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about his life. Octodad's existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.<br><br>In this sequel to the splash hit Octodad, our cephaloprotagonist has gotten himself in a bind between his wife’s mounting mistrust, and a disastrous trip to the local aquarium! Are you dad enough to control the titular octopus father as he strives to hide his nautical nature from his family while keeping his tangled tentacles intact?<br><br>In Octo-ber 2010, a group of university students released the original Octodad into the world. Despite everyone being convinced that the game was about a normal human dad, the game was a cult hit, gained critical acclaim, and was an Independent Games Festival Student Finalist in 2011. Octodad received enough attention that the team decided to run a Kickstarter, form the game studio Young Horses, and create a bigger, better, more polished game about Octodad.

<br />
American scientists working for Department of Defense find out that this mineral is in fact identical to the substance used to power an extraterrestrial artifact in their possession. This object is called the EON (Extraterrestrial Object Nexus).<br />
<br />
It was found in 1919 by Colonel Emerson near the site of the Tunguska explosion. Emerson was the commander of a US military unit in charge of transporting US war supplies from the city of Vladivostok to the Eastern front during World War I.<br />

DoD Experiments have shown that items placed in the capsule are transported hundreds of thousands of years back in time. The American scientists were not able to understand its construction, nor could they manage to synthesize its fuel.

Their only weapon is a camcorder they must use to capture the horrible events unfolding as they progress through the game.

   <li><b>Outlast 2:</b> You are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch. You're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe. The investigation has led you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do.</li>
   <li><b>Outlast:</b> Outlast was released in Sept 2013. It has 4M+ downloads with an 80% MetaCritic. Over 50M YouTube views have been generated by gameplay walkthroughs. In the remote mountains of Colorado, horrors wait inside Mount Massive Asylum. A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, the asylum has been operating in strict secrecy... until now. You are Miles Upshur, an independent journalist, who breaks into the facility, and what you discover walks a terrifying line between science and religion, nature and something else entirely. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies with the terrible truth at the heart of Mount Massive.</li>
   <li><b>Outlast Whistleblower:</b> Outlast Whistleblower is the 2014 DLC prequel to Outlast. You are Waylon Park, a software engineer and the man who emailed journalists around the world - including Miles - at the beginning of Outlast. While at Mount Massive, Waylon developed a deep-seated distrust of the profit-motivated scientists and doctors leading dangerous and irresponsible experiments on their patients. Identifying with those poor souls fueled Waylon's anger, and set the stage for his unmasking of Mount Massive's rotten core.</li>

9642e758-eb07-4df4-9b30-0b6d53ed9bce,,"Heart of Eternity is a third-person action/RPG title, with a weighted balance between action and role-playing elements. There's no ""levels"" in the game: the world is indivisible, and does not require weighting before loading a specific area. The fantasy-universe Sarcus is populated with people, bloodthirsty orks, hardworking and greedy dwarfs, proud and haughty elves, treacherous half-goblins, refined and powerful vampires:<br><br>

The game is based on a unique RPG system, designed specially to fit the basic game features. There are five primary (strength, dexterity, endurance, intelligence, magical penetrability) and ten secondary parameters. The hero can choose one of four specialized weapon techniques (shield-sword, two-handed combat, range weapons) or develop multi-classes. There are 4 schools of magic to master. The gained knowledge can be revealed in 10 multi-classes. As a result we have 36 possibilities to combine magical and fighting powers!!! The player can also develop 8 skills that, allow to increase weapon and magic strength. All the items and weapons are correctly displayed on the character models. The armor protects exactly the part of the body, which is covered by it. The amount of damage that the hero receives depends not only on the thickness of the armor, but on its form too.<br><br>

The game's story is non-linear: 100-150 multi-variant quests included. By completing various tasks and slaying enemies, the player increases the level of the character and gains new skills. The gameplay is aimed at players who like to play RPG-games and enjoy dynamic action. Two LAN game-modes are supported (cooperative and deathmatch arena fighting).<br><br>

Survivors live in a world where resources are scarce, violence and murder are common and Freakers roam the wilderness.
<br /><br />
Players face this violent, new world as Deacon St. John, a bounty hunter, a Drifter who lives in the lawless wilderness outside the civilian encampments. Deacon survives by using skills learned before the world ended, riding for the Mongrels MC, an outlawed motorcycle club, where violence and mayhem were part of the riding the open road.
<br /><br />
At the center of it all, Days Gone is an exploration of how any of us would react to these harsh conditions, and exploration of loss, love, friendship, revenge and desperation - learning that surviving isn't living. For Deacon especially, it's a struggle to ensure that hope never dies.
<br /><br />
<ul>
   <li><b>Expansive Open World Action</b> - Exemplifying truly free-form gameplay, Days Gone offers freedom to explore, strategize and play ""your way"" in the vast high-desert of the Pacific Northwest. The hazardous environments, filled with carved out ridges, mountains, caves, cliffs mines and river basins, deliver a breathtaking backdrop to an equally diverse style of gameplay.</li>
   <li><b>Emergent Gameplay</b> - Featuring fully explorable environments and dynamic AI enemies, players will rely on their own abilities to strategize, craft weapons and tools, explore the world, and engage in combat. With almost every car, building and environment searchable, Days Gone delivers emergent gameplay possibilities, making a player's approach to combat and discovery a vital part of the experience.</li>
   <li><b>Stunning, Dynamic Graphics</b> - Using the power of PlayStation 4 and Unreal Engine 4, Bend Studio has developed a high volume of rendering and gameplay technology to deliver an incredibly realistic open world experience. Realistic weather effects, such as rain, wind, snow and day-night cycles impact the gameplay. The game's lighting is all real-time and reacts dynamically, the way the human iris does, as players move from one location to the next.</li>

Players will relive the events of ‘Operation Market Garden’ across the fields and towns of Holland. This massive Allied assault consisted of a coordination of the British and American Airborne to capture key bridges while the British XXXth Corps moved to reinforce them through Highway 69. However, consecutive delays in consolidating ground from the north of Belgium through Nijmegen forced the 1st British Airborne Division in Arnhem to make a stand much longer than anticipated. With no successful link between the XXXth Corps and the Airborne in sight, the seventh and final bridge in Arnhem was considered lost.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/736220/extras/Vehicles_PS.png?t=1529489117"" ><br><br>‘The Bloody Seventh’ is our name for the initial focus of the project as we feel it succinctly details the struggle that the British paratroopers had to endure while waiting for their army counterpart to establish a link through the lower Rhine.<br><br>Players will be given the option to fight with the British Airborne Division, British XXX Corps or several branches of the German Army, such as the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. It’s a rare opportunity to experience the intense battlefield that was the Battle of Arnhem, which stretched across farms, woods, villages and city areas.

   <li>    Aerial Strength - With the new physicality system, aerial battles are a completely unique experience this year. Use the left stick to battle the opposition to disrupt a larger more powerful player, or find the best position to make the header/volley.</li>
   <li>    1v1 Control - In PES 2016 the 1v1 player control have been enhanced, offering a wide range of movements with the existing controls. Response times have been improved allowing players to manoeuvre in tight situations, which also benefits the upgraded feint moves that allow sudden directional change that can cause defenders to lose their balance. The 1 on 1 situations now offer a great leap in exciting table-turning outcomes. Just as the real pitch offers opportunities for those brave enough to perform, players can pull off precise action, flexibly manoeuvre and pull away from the defender. Technique and timing lead to the defender to lose his balance, and creates great chances just as you pictured.</li>
   <li>    Perfect Defence - Performing a tackle at the perfect time will powerfully shove the player out of the way to secure the ball. The ball will immediately be yours, creating direct turnarounds and counter opportunities.</li>
   <li>    Intelligent Player AI - 2-3 player combination play will be available by the improved concept of team strategy, which depends on the type of tactic you set for your team. Players no longer are reliant on manually triggering a 1-2, with teammates intelligently running off passes into space.</li>
   <li>    Goal Keeper ID - In a bid to improve quality and add unique individuality in performance, new goal keeper parameters have been added, that now vary in Catching, Clearance, Collapsing and Deflecting. This adds character to the players, who you can count on catching the ball rather than punching, or are better at stopping close range shots.</li>
   <li>    Celebration Control - New for the series, players have full control over goal celebrations to maximize their excitement when scoring! Prompts appear after a goal to trigger a trademark celebration, or unique actions at the press of a button. Fundamental Changes - New significant improvements across key modes and features.</li>
   <li>    New Master League - The famous and hugely popular Master League sees a total revamp, allowing users to immerse themselves in the managerial world of soccer. Every element has been redesigned or reworked, from the vibrant and involving menus to the new and exciting player transfer system, PES 2016 see one of the series most integral modes redefine the single player experience.</li>
   <li>    New Visuals - Incorporating the many advancements of Fox Engine the visuals have seen a huge upgrade. See the rain splash as players slide in to win possession, or the turf kick up as you strike the ball into the top corner. New night-time lighting and real turf textures add to some of the many improvements.</li>
   <li>    Dynamic Weather - For the first time in the PES series dynamic weather has been introduced, with the chance of rain starting during the game. Combined with the ever more realistic ball physics, the rain changes how the game can be played with passes speeding up, and players less skilled to struggle with trapping. The defender taken by the 1 on 1 will be covered with pitch blades by slipping and falling. This feature is applied to all offline modes including the Master League, becoming an important element to decide the outcome of the match.</li>
   <li>    Human Motion - Seeking to humanize player movement, 3x new animations have been added to bring the in-game superstars to life. Goalkeepers have seen an abundance of save animations added, while outfield players shoot, pass, dribble and tackle in a countless variety depending on the situation. Players complain when a foul isn't given, or lament a teammate when a pass isn't made when in open space. The new 1v1 control also benefits from this, with players being able to fool their opponents with shimmies and feints, that can result in causing the opposing player to lose his balance and fall in the wrong direction!</li>
   <li>    New Ball Physics - The past few years has seen the series make huge advancements in ball physics, and for PES 2016 new levels of realism have been reached. Each spin, bobble and ricochet has been calculated using real ball physic data, helping keep every moment in every game unique and unpredictable.</li>

b5b1c754-6787-4a8c-aa0f-93720ac44e5d,,"Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 sees the return of the multi-award winning franchise complete with an abundance of new features and quality improvements. PES 2017 aims to retain its title of 'Best Sports Game' for a third year, as voted across the world at games shows and by major media outlets in 2014 and 2015.
<br /><br />
This year's tagline (creation concept)  'Control Reality' encapsulates the focus of this year's product, taking the award winning gameplay to a new level by achieving interactive reality in both control and its new standard of authentic visuals. The immersion in the game presentation and interactive, tactical elements  enhance the experience for the player, as the product aims to maximize the fun in playing against any player in every way. The industry leading Fox Engine again powers the series to reach new heights across the large amount of improvements, and with PES 2017 users will be able to experience real football for the first time in a video game.
<br /><br />
<ul>
   <li><b>Fundamental Gameplay Changes</b> - Key additions to the on-pitch experience</li>
   <ul><li><b>Real Touch</b> - In football, what dictates and separate the best from the rest is 1st touch control. In PES 2017 the 1st touch in calculated by player attributes as well as the further inclusion of real ball physics directly controlled by the input ball touch. See how different players control the ball in unique and different ways based on where and how you control them, dictating the flow of the game based on how they react to the unpredictable movement of the ball. In addition, there is more control in how you receive the pass, and depending on the pass the player can visually execute the exact play intended, from receiving a pass to sending the ball out again.</li>
   <li><b>Precise Pass</b> - Combining Real Touch and real ball physics, passing is an art form in PES 2017. Many factors determine the speed and accuracy of the ball. The base is the player rates and skills, and adding to these are the players direction and angle that links to the natural, satisfying animation to follow. The pass that is made on the best situation and timing will generate a perfect trajectory, creating a great satisfaction when a killer pass is made. </li>
   <li><b>Authentic Visuals</b> - For PES 2017 the visuals have seen a major upgrade, offering Authentic Visuals thanks to the further incorporation of Fox Engine. The lighting sources have increased by double this year as well as the crowd models and pitch textures overhauled, making the visuals more realistic than ever. Details such as being able to see the players breathing in winter, the net to splash some rain off  when the ball hits in rainy weather, and the debris of the pitch flying when they are kicked up. Shadows in the day matches are more recognizable, and some of the spray line for the free kick lines are seen throughout as subtle enhancements. Nothing has been left untouched, from player models, lighting, crowds, pitch  and stadiums totally revamped. Never has a game looked so real</li>
   <li><b>Natural Player Movement</b> - New features such as Real Touch and Precise Pass see huge benefit as hundreds of new animations have been added, giving a vast array of movements when trapping and passing the ball. The player interactions (collisions) are also further developed with player individuality clearly represented in detailed movement (e.g. Giroud strong in physicality, Özil strong in balance). The representation for balance in the body when being physically challenged is strongly supported through the 2 new parameters.</li>
   <li><b>Goal Keeping</b> - Keepers see a great jump in quality through added motions and animations, creating the most agile keepers in PES history. They instantly react to shots including a fast follow up, springing into action after landing. Further improvement have made to a variety of situations the Goalkeeper will face, including 3 significant areas. These include deflection when the shot is near their feet, instant reaction to shot to the side they are not expecting, and fingertip saves to defend shots right before it goes past the goal line. With the new intelligent keepers scoring a goal will not be a simple task. The ball physics when the keeper saves is close to real life, which can be seen in how a shot is deflected based on which part of the keeper it hits. Attacking moments will be more dramatic than ever, bringing the best feeling of achievement when that goal is scored.</li>
   <li><b>Total Team Control</b> - The series is known for incredible depth when controlling how your team plays, and with Total Team Control in PES 2017 users have new on the fly options during a match. Users can instantly change the attacking and defending mentality of the team, which can be tweaked and carefully controlled with simple controls, being able to immediately react to the unpredictability of the sport. Defend a lead or drive the team forward to score a goal, the choice is yours. </li>
   <li><b>Corner Kick Control</b> - Control the defensive and offensive strategies on a set pieces to add a new dimension to corner kicks. By tapping the d-pad on a corner, a variety of options come up allowing the user to tailor each moment to their playing style. Defensive options include choosing to marking zonal or Man to Man. Offensive options are also included, such as flooding the 6 yard box, or 'Train' which sees players attack the ball in a straight line.</li>
   <li><b>Advanced Instructions</b> - Strategies that are quite individually defined such as Tiki-taka and tight marking which is strongly based on team ideology can be now set in ""Advanced Instructions"", which adds a huge variety in how you plan to win. The renowned strategy to go in for heavy pressing such as Gegenpressing , the counter target strategy to not go all-in on pressing and heavy man-mark that some teams put into practice are all in this strategy setting. This vividly adds that team identity and makes winning more rewarding, but most of all making the match more fun through tactical strategies. </li>
   <li><b>Adaptive AI</b> - For the first time in a football game, the AI will learn how you play, listen to your strategy plans, follow your Advanced Instructions, and change their tactics accordingly! Pass to a star player often? The opposition will double up on him and mark heavily. Like to constantly play down the wings? Players will cover their fullbacks to make you think twice! The AI will also adapt its attacking tactics, so if you are intercepting the opposition's long passes they will change to a short passing game! Player and team behavior has always been a staple of the PES series, and for PES 2017 Adaptive AI will change sports games forever.</li></ul>

   <li>Directors will also play their role on giving advice to the player  for negotiations.</li>
   <li>Team role which has been a popular addition since 2016 sees further enhancement with now 22 roles compared to 10 in PES 2016, with added roles such as 'Hero' and 'Bad Boy'. This allows for more character establishment for your team.</li>
   <li>Player Growth system has been improved, with players now acquiring not just abilities as in PES 2016 but also skills. Some players may see a boost in their abilities while on loan.</li>

   <li><b>Quality Improvements</b> - Many important elements are upgraded per fan feedback.</li>
   <ul><li><b>Referees</b> - Improved judgment on player collisions to determine fouls. Smaller fouls will be called up, as well as extra intelligence when playing the advantage rule, including going back to  book players after an earlier challenge</li>

Like many others of his rank, he had been ordered by Kazim to wed a human spouse in order to try to father a child of Fate – a future Watcher. And like many others, he succeeded.<br><br>The kids that were born this way didn’t have a name for the first twenty years of their lives. They formed a coalition of strictly trained warriors, children fighters educated to reach excellency in all domains. Young or old, these units were called the Heralds of Dis. The Heralds were nameless ghosts under the direct orders of Kazim, and carried out his wishes with flawless efficiency. Bribery, poisoning and espionage for the youngest; diplomacy, direct murder and raids for the older ones.<br><br>The son of Tarund received an especially spartan schooling: his father didn’t tolerate failure or mistakes, and each misstep was punished by a cruel flogging.

This gives the multiplayer game more depth than ever before, as individual matches now matter for the overall victory or loss in the MP campaign. Both sides battle it out to control territories on a large scale battle map, voting on which territories to attack, whether to attempt to take more territory, or to defend and try to grind down the enemy's resources. We like to say it is like a “meta-game&quot; of Risk. This features both Stalingrad and Pacific Theater campaigns. <br></li><li>All new level: Betio. The tiny island of Betio was the scene of the heaviest fighting during the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943, the first major US amphibious offensive of the Pacific Theater. The map here recreates the push of the US 2nd Marine Division across the devastated island against their counterparts in the 6th Special Naval Landing Force (the Japanese 'Marines') as the US forces attempt to disable key tactical objectives such as naval guns and transmitter stations. The map favors desperate pitched defenses and assaults at all costs. <br></li><li>Two new weapons, one for Rising Storm and one for Red Orchestra 2. Red Orchestra 2 gets the PPS-42 submachine gun. Born out of desperation during the siege of Leningrad, the PPS-42 provides the Russians with a powerful, lightweight SMG option. For Rising Storm, the Japanese get the Type 97 sniper rifle. More accurate than the existing Type 99 sniper rifle, this weapon gives the Japanese another way to reach out and touch their enemies. <br></li><li>Classic Mode Refinements. While Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2 are considered by many to be one of the most hardcore shooters out there, the hardcore among the fan base have been clamoring for something even more extreme and authentic. The fans have asked and we've answered with further refinements to Classic Mode (the most hardcore gameplay mode in RS/RO2). We've made player movement changes, as well as aiming and recoil changes to make it more difficult to keep your aim on enemies resulting in longer and more intense firefights. </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Previous Updates:</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Counterattack Map Contest Pack 1: 4 new maps!<br></li><li>Counterattack Map Contest Pack 2: 3 new maps!</li></ul></p><br><h1>Digital Deluxe Edition</h1><p><img src=""http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/234510/extras/game_page_banner_tweaked.jpg"" ><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Day 1 Unlock of: the US M12 Trench shotgun, the Japanese Type 99 Machine Gun, the Japanese Type 99 Sniper Rifle with 4X scope (level 2), and the US M1 Garand with bayonet (Level 2).<br></li><li>2 Rising Storm soldier playable characters for Killing Floor. <br></li><li>Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2 soundtracks.<br></li><li>Will include the Red Orchestra 2 Steam Digital Deluxe Edition Upgrade (4 day 1 unlock weapons, 2 playable RO2 KF characters, and 2 RO2 hats in TF2).</li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>INCLUDES ALL RED ORCHESTRA 2 MULTIPLAYER CONTENT!</strong></h2><br>Rising Storm is the next game in the award-winning Red Orchestra franchise. You know the great gameplay, innovative features and realistic audio and graphics of RO2 - Rising Storm will take this to the Pacific Theater, adding even more features, new levels, new weapons and new factions. The game will allow the player to fight across iconic locations from the famous island-hopping campaigns in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, as the US Army and Marine Corps fight it out with the Imperial Japanese army and Special Naval Landing Forces. Players will experience beach assaults, jungle fighting, close quarters night fighting and more across Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and Saipan, among other iconic battles. The player is able to take the part of either side – American or Japanese – battling it out online in multiplayer on up to 64-player servers.<br><br>Rising Storm also introduces an entirely new type of gameplay to the franchise - asymmetrical warfare. The American’s have the apparent advantage in firepower with their fast firing semi-automatic rifles, fully automatic weapons, and devastating flamethrower. The Japanese balance this out with gameplay elements that model their raw courage, ferocity, and cunning use of equipment. Their knee mortars allow them to rain indirect fire down on their enemies from anywhere in the map. Grenades can be planted and turned into booby-traps for unwary GIs. The Japanese put very high store on close-quarter combat, with a bayonet on almost every weapon – even machine guns and SMGs. Their banzai charge suppresses the enemy making it difficult for them to return fire and gives them an opportunity to close in to use bayonets and katanas on their opponents.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>	Large Scale Multiplayer Combat in The Pacific: Take part in the brutal fighting in the Pacific online with up to 64 players at a time.<br></li><li>	Iconic Battles:  Experience iconic battles such as Iwo Jima, Saipan, and Guadalcanal as the US military struggles to clear the Japanese from the islands in the Pacific.<br></li><li>	Asymmetrical Gameplay: Far from the mirrored gameplay seen in other shooters, both sides utilize historical weapon sets and each have unique gameplay capabilities. American firepower is matched by Japanese ferocity and guile with such features as banzai charges, booby-traps, the infamous “knee mortar” and more. This creates a unique gameplay experience that can’t be found anywhere else. <br></li><li>	WWII weaponry redefined – again: all of the weapon functionality you expect from the franchise returns - true to life ballistics, bullet penetration, breathing, adjustable sights, free aim, weapon bracing, and more, create WWII weaponry that has no equal. To that add over 20 new weapons including the devastating flamethrower and the portable “knee mortar”.<br></li><li>	Morale: Your soldier’s state of mind plays a bigger role than ever. Banzai charging Japanese soldiers can heavily suppress the Americans making it difficult to return fire and allowing the Japanese to close the distance.  The Americans can use their firepower advantage to suppress their enemies and gain the advantage!<br></li><li>	Bonus Content: All Red Orchestra 2 multiplayer content is included with Rising Storm as a free bonus. Fight in the Pacific, then fight on the Eastern Front at any time, all in the same game and same server browser.

9bded937-0b0e-4676-bbd7-4ca42131aed4,RoBoRumble,"<strong>RoBoRumble</strong> is a real-time 3D strategy game, offering two major battle campaigns consisting of 15 missions each and a multi-player mode with hot combat for up to four players at a time. One of <strong>RoBoRumble</strong>'s key features is the unique way in which Units are assembled. Unlike most games of this type, where the player is given a palette of already designed Units to choose from, in <strong>RoBoRumble</strong> the player constructs his own from a palette of different components. This gives a far greater number of variations and adds an extra strategic dimension to the game. <br><br>Each Unit (known as a &quot;Robo&quot;) consists of a chassis and a weapon mounted on it. Available chassis designs range from two- or four-legged runners to jet-propelled, tracked or wheel-based craft and even tele-porters. There's also no shortage of weapons to mount on them. In addition to the standard lasers, heavy artillery and machine guns, <strong>RoBoRumble</strong> offers some imaginative creations like an &quot;Oiler&quot;, that slows the enemy down by leaving slippery pools in his path, and the &quot;Whirlwind&quot;, that picks up the enemy and throws him against the nearest wall.  Each of the two parties in the conflict have eight different chassis and weapons to choose from.  One side leans more toward &quot;brawn&quot;, utilizing pure firepower, while the other tries the &quot;brains&quot; method of better weapons design. Whichever side the player chooses, only a small pool of weapons is available at the beginning. The player can increase the pool by giving out development contracts between missions.<br><br>The third optional component of a Robo is the so-called &quot;Booster&quot;. This normally costs only a fraction of the other two components, but can have a huge effect on the game. Some Boosters double the Robo's speed, while others give the Robo more firepower or firing range, make him invisible, or increase his intelligence. <br><br>The relatively complex way of creating Robos stands in heavy contrast to the intentionally simple resource management. The source and at the same time, the main base, of the player's and the enemy's army is a dome-shaped, glowing &quot;Energy Pool&quot;, which he must protect from attacks. The pool's capacity, which varies with each mission, is given to the player as a &quot;budget&quot; and used to create Robos. When a Robo is destroyed, his &quot;energy&quot; (the energy which was invested in creating him), flows back into the pool, so the player can build new units.<br><br>The base consists of three different energy levels. Whenever one of these levels comes under sustained fire and is destroyed, it triggers a violent explosion that, in turn, destroys all enemies in the immediate area. This &quot;cleansing&quot; effect sees to it that the defending party gains time to gather his troops and go on the counterattack.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>STORY</strong></h2>The distant future – the planet Mars. The biggest arms contract in the history of the human race will be given to one side. The most powerful prototypes square off in a head-to-head battle. The winner closes the deal of a lifetime and gets the honor of defending Earth in the Final Battle against the evil Aliens. Will that lucky person be you?<br><br>Build powerful battle robots from components like Chassis, Weapon and Booster. The battle’s starting and you’re right in the thick of things – with freely definable camera perspectives, spectacular effects, unlimited zoom and scroll, colored light sources, terrain morphing and 3D sound. Pure action – pure excitement!<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>FEATURES:</strong></h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Tactical 3D real-time strategy game which breaks free of the normal conventions<br></li><li>More than just a “shoot-em-up” – unusual features and innovative weapon systems add a complex element to this easy-to-play game<br></li><li>Over 30 missions in two campaigns<br></li><li>The “building block” principle lets you assemble a battle robot to fit your tactics – literally hundreds of different combinations are possible!<br></li><li>You can freely move, rotate or tilt the camera perspective<br></li><li>Multi-player mode supports up to 4 players in direct competition over LAN or Internet</li></ul>"

<br />
A group of stalkers, for the first time, reaches the very heart of the Zone-the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant-and triggers a cataclysm on the brink of a catastrophe. An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone map. Stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost territories.<br />
<br />
With the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable Zone continues to tremor with outbursts. The transformation of the Zone map destabilizes the fragile balance of forces in the Zone. Hostilities for the new territories, artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. There are no more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. The Factions War has begun.<br />
<br />
The protagonist is a mercenary who appeared at the edge of the opposition between stalker factions, Strelok and even the Zone itself. The main character experiences the key role in the events that led to the creation of the Zone right up to the point from which the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game begins.<br />
<br />
What new challenges await stalkers within the depths of the new zone? Why do anomalous outbursts continue to rattle the Zone, and what can be done to stop them? Which faction will take the upper hand in the Factions War? These and many other questions will be answered in the official prequel - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky."

Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. <br><br><br>It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed.

a623b257-55da-46ce-9f5f-15e90ca970c6,,"Sniper Ghost Warrior is set on the fictitious South American island of Isla Trueno, where a despotic military regime lead by the ruthless General Vasquez has overthrown its democratic government to seize control. As one of a group of covert commandos, the player is charged with infiltrating the rebel stronghold and overthrowing the unelected powerbase. Intelligence reports indicate that Vasquez is due to chair a meeting with his cohorts in an old refinery facility, and a government plant is in place to set up an assassination opportunity for the crack unit. But as the unit arrive on the island, it soon becomes clear that the plan has gone awry, and the team must adapt and use their combat skills if they are to complete the mission.<br /><br />

Realism is at the heart of Sniper Ghost Warrior, and the game enjoys a truly realistic ballistic system that accounts for the distance of a shot, fall-off of the bullet's trajectory, and environmental factors, such as wind direction. Similarly, the lush jungle environments, allow the user to use the cover of the foliage to take out key targets, while other members of your squad can act as 'spotters' to detail the positions of key adversaries. Players must also manage the breathing of their sniper to provide a more accurate shot, while the game's 'Bullet Cam' system offers stunning close-ups as the bullets thud into their unsuspecting targets.<br /><br />

The mission spans 16 stages, starting with the problematic assassination attempt at the refinery, and moving on to oilrigs, a mine, the coast, and a set of ruins as the game's plot continually surprises. Each level is brought to vivid life with the many rustles of the jungle keeping the player in a constant state of alert, and the sniper elements mixed with incredible firefights, as the enemy break cover and the squad is forced to engage in open combat.<br /><br />

It takes the bulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights, offering more diverse sniper challenges; a rebuilt AI system and the thrilling “one shot, one kill” precision that made the original a huge hit, selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 also delivers striking graphic environments.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>	Motion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in real-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the pad’s trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.<br></li><li>	Realistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the realism of its shooting dynamics.  Wind speed, distance, gravity and bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.<br></li><li>	Refined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your round, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head. From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper must pull together everything to achieve the ideal “one shot; one kill.”<br></li><li>	Improved Enemy AI: the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was completely re-tooled and designed from scratch.  Much of the improvements were made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything from flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage you in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.<br></li><li>	New Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever. <br></li><li>	Various Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible to the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to play – either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and experience the game on Expert Mode.<br></li><li>	Bullet-Cam: everyone’s favorite feature returns to reward expert shots and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint. See what the transfer of kinetic energy – a bullet’s true stopping power – can do to the enemy from 1000 meters or more!<br></li><li>	Bullet Penetration: concealment doesn’t necessarily mean cover. In Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, bullets behave as they would in real life and are able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You can also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an entire squad. Wait ‘til you see that on Bullet Cam!<br></li><li>	Expanded List of Sniper Rifles: Try out the world’s most advanced sniper rifles, each of them meticulously recreated so that they accurately simulate the modern weaponry found on today’s battlefields.<br></li><li>	New Gear: own the night with the introduction of thermal and night vision optics, plus a pair of powerful binoculars critical for locating the enemy before they spot you.</li></ul>"

Is it the dream game you've been waiting years for or the complete opposite? Review this list carefully as we do not want to waste anyone's time with a game not suited to their tastes:<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> <strong><u>Stash is a complex, deep game that requires skill, thought, and effort to excel.</u></strong> It also takes time to learn. <i><strong>We do not have a guided tutorial</strong></i>. We have <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1133185739"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  >guides</a></a>, videos, in-game tutorial help screens, and both staff and community volunteers who love helping people. If you prefer games with a 1 hour automatic guided tutorial that teaches you how to play, you may have trouble with Stash. <br><br></li><li> <u>Stash embraces the grind.</u> We believe we've made it fun, and it definitely isn't fast. Your accomplishments are meaningful and you won't get passed up if you go on vacation for a week. This goes for combat, crafting, farming, empire building, and pretty much everything.<br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Stash is challenging but approachable.</u></strong> You can make Stash easier with dungeon difficulty settings, partying with other players, or simply focusing on easier content. But some battles can be quite difficult with good strategy and tactics heavily rewarded. Fleeing from battle is not easy or guaranteed. If you die after a certain level, there is a death penalty (you do not lose XP, levels, or items, but instead receive a small amount of XP debt - half your earned XP pays off debt until it is gone, but you can still level up and progress even while you have xp debt!). <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Questing is not a big part of Stash</u>.</strong> We don't like quest grinds. Stash is more of a sandbox-style game. We have quest-type activities (we call them tasks), but they are not a huge focus of the game. The world is open to you to set your own goals and priorities and we do not tell you what you have to do next. <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Crafting and Merchants are big parts of the game</u>.</strong> The best gear in the game is crafted gear, and many systems allow for merchants to play an important role in the economy. <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Your BOO (Base of Operations or house) is a major aspect of character progression.</u></strong> Expanding and upgrading your BOO allows more and faster crafting, more market options, more storage, and more fun. If you love housing then you will probably love Stash.<br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Storage and carrying capacity are part of character progression.</u></strong> Unlocking more bag slots, getting better bags, upgrading your stash, upgrading your stall, and other storage options are all aspects of advancing your character. Some people think this is great. Some people think this is tedious. If it sounds tedious, Stash is not for you. <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>There is no Auction House.</u></strong> Every player has their own merchant stall and can advertise items in the newspapers (which are divided by item category). Our economy encourages people to build their reputation as a merchant or craftsman. Auction Houses are cool but create race to the bottom pricing that leaves little room for sellers to compete on anything other than price. If you like a market that provides opportunities for full time merchants and market arbitrage, you will enjoy Stash. <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Stash is currently light on story, but that is changing fast.</u></strong> You, as a player, will be a huge part of that. Our studio has run a roleplay required, all text MUD for 21 years. Please trust us that story and lore are near and dear to our heart, and will be a huge part of Stash. <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>The World will grow based on player actions.</u></strong> You currently have access to one major capital city, 9 major regions, and 41 dungeons. As the story unfolds, players will open up more of the world. If you prefer an MMO with the entire world available for exploration right away, you might be disappointed. If you like the idea of shaping and unlocking the world as a community, you will be thrilled.<br><br></li><li> <strong><u>We have many unique game mechanics rarely or never seen in other MMOs.</u></strong> We have a fresh take on stat training, healing, character customization, gear upgrading, and many other things. If that sounds fun and interesting, Stash is your game.<br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Stash has only just begun.</u></strong> We are a small team of passionate, indie devs who want to create a game you can call home for many years to come. If you want to be part of that growth, you will love Stash. If you don't want to be part of that journey, you might want to wait a bit.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Extra Packages for Stash</h2><br>There are two packages available which include the game, your $ value worth of Medallions (virtual currency), and some bonus items:<br><br><strong><u>Citizen Package</u></strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Total Value: $22.00<br></li><li> $15 worth of medallions<br></li><li> Mount: donkey<br></li><li> +25% XP Booster (2 hour duration) x2<br></li><li> Healing Potion x5<br></li><li> Mana Potion x5</li></ul><br><strong><u>Founder's Package</u></strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Total Value: $75.00+<br></li><li> $50 worth of medallions<br></li><li> Mount: donkey<br></li><li> +25% XP Booster (2 hour duration) x4<br></li><li> Healing Potion x10<br></li><li> Mana Potion x10<br></li><li> <strong>Founder's Cloak</strong> - Fancy cloak that provides +20% XP until you reach level 20.<br></li><li> <strong>Founder's Monument</strong> - Special outdoor item for your Base of Operations (BOO)<br></li><li> <strong>Founders Weapon Display Case</strong> - Special interior item for your BOO</li></ul><br><a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://forums.frogdice.com/showthread.php/8812-HOW-TO-CLAIM-YOUR-CODE-AND-GET-REWARDS"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""  >Click here for step by step instructions on how to get your medallions and in-game bonus items.</a></a>"

This new game puts players in command of detailed, historically accurate tanks, troops, and vehicles at the height of World War II.  Players can measure their tactical skills against several opponents in big multiplayer battles or against enemies in a challenging single-player campaign. Steel Division: Normandy 44  allows players to take control over legendary military divisions from six different countries, such as the American 101st Airborne, the German armored 21st Panzer or the 3rd Canadian Division, during the invasion of Normandy in 1944. <br><br><strong>Main Features:</strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Command Over 400 Historically Accurate Units:</h2> Whether fighting for control in intense multiplayer battles with up to 10-vs-10 players going head-to-head, playing alone or working with friends in ranked matches, players will need to coordinate their selection of historically accurate infantry, tanks, aircraft, and support vehicles to counter enemy units in this Tactical RTS game.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Real-world Tactics: </h2>Battles rage over three distinct phases, where different units unlock over time, mimicking the movements of real-world armies and adding variety to the ever-changing theatre of war. A dynamic front line illustrates the ebb and flow of the conflict.  Pin down your opponent's infantry to gain the advantage and force a retreat, or push through with a perfectly executed plan.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Real-world Setting:</h2>Using the latest version of Eugen’s IRISZOOM engine, players can smoothly zoom from a tactical aerial view all the way down to a single unit, and see 400 different real-world vehicles and units designed with careful historical detail and accuracy. Maps are designed based on actual aerial reconnaissance photos of Normandy in 1944, requiring real-world tactics and strategies to cover and control.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Outplan, Outsmart, Outgun:</h2>From battlegroup customization to troop positioning and maneuvering, winning battles requires cunning and strategy, not just raw firepower. Each unit lost presents a growing tactical disadvantage, and players will need to fight to gain -- and keep -- the upper hand.<br><br>From commanding historically accurate infantry, tanks, and vehicles, to troop positioning and real-time engagement with the enemy, players will need to be clever and resourceful in order to win. Every unit counts as the battle presses on, and raw firepower alone will not be enough to claim victory. Whether viewing the entire battle from an aerial perspective, or following a single tank into a firefight, players will need to cleverly manage the dynamic front line in order to execute ambushes and advances."

<br />
Navigate the player to the landing pad through twenty increasingly difficult levels within the time limit and with enough fuel. Movement or firing uses up fuel though levels can be replenished by shooting the fuel dumps. Running out of fuel means you loose control and can't fire. If all fuel dumps are destroyed on any given level the player's fuel tank capacity is doubled for the next level (this does not apply to starting from the highest level reached).<br />
<br />
Avoid the moving doors and increasingly fiendish enemies, find the switches for the doors that block your way.<br />
<br />
When a life is lost the player is temporarily shielded against enemy fire, this is represented by an electrical circular field around the lander just after it is respawned.<br />
<br />
Don't touch anything - that would be fatal!<br />
<br />
Be careful though, loosing a life resets the current level and loosing the last life ends the game."

Although the positive impact of this revolution is obvious, every coin has a flipside; for every beneficial device developed with these new materials, so too were advanced weapons and other implements of war. Thus, the land became mired with turmoil, and remains in such a state even now.<br><br>Enter, the bracers: an organization established to serve as police and intermediaries alike, holding above all else the peace and safety of the lands under their jurisdiction.

$1 from each purchase goes to War Child, a charity helping children in conflict-affected areas  <br />
www.warchild.org.uk<br />
<br />
This War of Mine: The Little Ones explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.<br />
<br />
A word from the developers: &quot;From our perspective, adding children to the experience was the most important move to complete the big picture. But it required utmost respect for victims of war, so understandably, we wanted to present the topic without any gratuitous gore. In fact, our goal was to show how little ones perceive the reality of an armed conflict. And again, if you decide to purchase the DLC, you're contributing one dollar to War Child. Thank you!&quot;<br />
<br />
This War of Mine: The Little Ones:<br />
<br />
- Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine<br />
- Protect innocent children<br />
- Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need<br />

Torment: Tides of Numenera is a single-player, isometric, narrative-driven role-playing game set in Monte Cook’s Numenera universe, and brought to you by the creative team behind Planescape: Torment and the award-winning <strong>Wasteland 2</strong>. <br><br>Features: <ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>A Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story.</strong> The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively.

Powered by technology used in the award-winning Pillars of Eternity by Obsidian Entertainment, the Numenera setting by Monte Cook provides endless wonders and impossibly imaginative locations for you to explore. <br></li><li><strong>A Rich, Personal Narrative.</strong> Thoughtful and character-driven, the story is epic in feel but deeply personal in substance, with nontraditional characters and companions whose motivations and desires shape their actions throughout the game. <br></li><li><strong>Reactivity, Replayability, and the Tides.</strong> Your choices matter, and morality in the Ninth World is not a simple matter of “right” and “wrong”.

The peoples of these regions came collectively to be known as the Anglo Saxons.<br><br><img src=""https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/712100/extras/Alfred_The_Lad.jpg?t=1525361900"" crossorigin=""anonymous""><br><br><strong>West Seaxe</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Alfred</strong><br><br>As the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom of southern England, the forces of West Seaxe – or Wessex in modern English – provided the isle’s primary resistance against the incursions of the Great Heathen Army. From the capital city of Winchester, Wessex conquered lands in Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex and even Mercia. Alfred’s dogged defense of the Danish invasion laid the foundations for Wessex to unite England under one ruler for the first time in 927 AD.<br><br><strong>Mierce</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Ceowulf</strong><br><br>From its capital city of Tamworth, the kings of Mierce – known now as Merica - ruled the area now known as the Midlands. At its height, Mierce stretched from Northumbria in the north of England to Kent, Sussex and Wessex to the south. In 877 AD, the Great Heathen Army seized the eastern part of the kingdom to form the Danelaw, or East Engle.<br><br><strong>The Gaels – Mide and Circenn</strong><br><br>Gaelic culture initially developed in Ireland, their society built around a system of clans and chieftains. They raided and traded with Roman settlements, and by 878 AD had expanded from Ireland to inhabit much of Scotland.<br>With the influx of the Vikings, some raiders settled in Gaelic lands, becoming the Norse-Gaels. The Scottish Gaels would absorb the Picts to become the Kingdom of Alba – essentially setting the blueprint for modern Scotland. <br><br><strong>Mide</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Flann Sinna</strong><br><br>Mide lies at the heart of Ireland. Not just geographically, but politically, intellectually and spiritually. Many High Kings have risen from Mide, and its current ruler, Flann Sinna, aspires to that title.<br><br>With many fellow Irish factions nearby, Mide is in a position to potentially bring the disparate clans together, and usher in an era of Irish prosperity. However, threats are never far away… the Vikings of Dyflin have settled to the east, and their power and influence are growing. Will Mide strive to keep the uneasy peace? Unite the clans in a war against these Norse settlers? Or find some other route to supremacy?  <br><br><strong>Circenn</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Áed mac Cináeda</strong><br><br>Circenn was in origin Pictish, but became more heavily influenced by the Gaels and other peoples over time as they were driven away from the relentless Viking raids. 878 AD marked the end of the Viking invasions, but Circenn’s troubles were far from over. While she had a firm hold over the eastern coast of Scotland, many threats still exist – both within and without.   <br><br>Scoan, the capital of Circenn, was once home to the legendary Stone of Destiny, said to bestow divine strength on her people. Where the stone now resides is a mystery, but if clues can be found, surely the Stone’s recovery would be an adventure worth undertaking…<br><br><strong>The Welsh – Gwined and Strat Clut</strong><br><br>The Welsh Kingdoms descended from the Celtic Britons who occupied much of the island of Britain from the Iron Age, into and beyond its Romanisation in the First Century. <br><br>Ironically, the term ‘Welsh’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon term for foreigner, ‘wealas’, which they applied to the native Britons. The Anglo-Saxons flourished and many of the old Brittonic kingdoms began to disappear. <br><br><strong>Gwined</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Anaraut</strong><br><br>The people of Gwined have some claim to the title of 'true Britons', having been driven to the far west by invaders who now call themselves ‘English’. Renowned both for their bardic arts and their skill with the longbow, the Welsh of Gwined thrived under the leadership of Rhodri Mawr. <br><br>Rhodri kept Gwined largely free of Vikings and other invaders while expanding its borders. Now he is gone and his lands are divided. <br><br><strong>Strat Clut</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Run</strong><br><br>Strat Clut is a kingdom of the Old North that can be traced back to the Fifth Century and the Celtic Britons. The realm was formerly based at the fortress of Alt Clut but driven out by a Viking invasion in 870. The current King Artgal was taken captive and reportedly killed in mysterious circumstances. The kingdom reformed further into the valley of the River Clyde under the leadership of his only son Run.<br><br><strong>The Great Viking Army – Northymbre and East Engle</strong><br><br>In 865 AD, Ragnar’s sons led the Great Viking Army and made landfall in East Anglia. Over the next 15 years the Vikings ranged high and low, from Wessex to The Clyde, conquering towns, claiming victories and suffering their share of defeats until the Battle of Edington in 878 AD, where its leader Guthrum met his match in the young King Alfred and his West Saxon army. Bested in the field, his forces retreated in disarray to a nearby fortress. Flush with success, Alfred’s men gave chase and laid siege. After a fortnight of starvation, the invaders surrendered.<br><br>Under the terms of his capitulation, Guthrum was baptised into Christianity and he and his men were allowed to return to East Anglia and settle – provided they kept Alfred’s peace, of course.<br>Defeated, but never humbled, the Vikings seethe with an all-consuming rage. One does not cage the wolf without consequence…<br><br><strong>Northymbre</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Guthfrid</strong><br><br>When the Vikings arrived in Northumbria in 867 AD, they took the city of York – or Eoferwic, as was – for their stronghold. And what a bastion it was, with its formidable Roman walls still standing strong 700 years on. King Aelle of Northumbria attempted to wrest the city back from the Danes, but was captured during the attack. In retribution for Aelle’s execution of their father, the sons of Ragnar made an example of him with the horrifying Blood Eagle ritual.<br><br>Northumbria remained under Viking control and, after the battle of Edington and the subsequent treaty of Wedmore, a portion of the Great Viking Army marched back to Northumbria, to settle under Alfred’s peace.<br><br><strong>East Engle</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Guthrum</strong><br><br>Forming the bulk of Britannia’s south-easterly coast, East Engle was the staging-point of the Great Viking Army’s invasion, and the region where many of its warriors settled after the Battle of Edington. Under the rule of the Danish leader Guthrum (or Æthelstan, to use his adoptive name by Alfred) it would ultimately come to be known as the Danelaw.<br>Yet still, some fight remains in the Danes of East Engle. One does not shed the mantle of glory and become a landsman overnight.<br><br><strong>The Viking Sea Kings – Dyflin and Sudreyar</strong><br><br>After nearly a century of escalating raids, the Vikings left an indelible stamp on Britannia, altering the course of its history forever. Not least of all culturally, as many smaller bands of Vikings had settled around the isles prior to Alfred’s defeat of the Great Viking army.<br>These smaller factions traded an existence of ceaseless conflict for a new life in Britannia, establishing their own petty principalities, intermarrying and ultimately becoming part of the warp-and-woof of Britannic life. This mingling of cultures, so emblematic of British history, helped create the rich melting-pot of attitudes, beliefs and language that has made the isles and their people so unique.<br><br>Some Vikings never truly settled however; their designs were grander, their hunger for conquest and greatness unquenched. These Sea Kings would continue their bellicose work, heedless of any decree from England’s upstart ruler…<br><br><strong>Dyflin</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Bardr</strong><br><br>Dyflin was a major port town on the east coast of Ireland, and the site of Britannia’s largest slave market. It was a major site of Viking occupation, and was ruled until 873 by the Viking lord Imar, often associated with Ivar the Boneless, a son of the legendary Viking warlord Ragnar Lothbrok. Viking raiders had wintered there as early as 840 AD, so their association with the region had been a long one, and over time their customs began to take on a more Gaelic flavour as the slow process of integration took its course. <br><br>By 878 AD however, Imar’s son Bardr was firmly established on the throne. Would this ambitious Viking ruler seek to seal a lasting peace with the surrounding Gaelic factions? Or return to the ways of Ragnar, and pursue a path of bloodshed and domination? It is hard to ignore the calling of one’s warrior-blood… <br><br><strong>Sudreyar</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Eirik</strong><br><br>To the west of Alba lies Sudreyar, the Kingdom of the Southern Isles. Comprising the southern Hebrides, these scattered islands were sparsely populated and, bearing the full brunt of the Atlantic weather, were not lands suited to the less-hardy.<br><br>Like much of Britannia, these islands saw increasing Viking contact from the 8th Century. Prior to this period they formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada, until they fell under Viking control. Over the next century, Scandinavian occupancy took on a distinctly Gaelic flavour (and vice-versa), particularly after 872 AD when Harald Fairhair became king of Norway, and his former opponents flocked to the area.<br><br>Materially poor, but offering an excellent base for those of a nautical bent, the isles of Sudreyar are a perfect staging-post for raiders and explorers."

But even after the apocalypse there are men willing to give everything to return to light, to knowledge, to civilisation. Whatever the cost, and whatever the means...<br><br>It is the age of a chosen few, an age of greatness, when the first true kings built vast kingdoms from the ashes of past empires... it is the Age of Charlemagne.<br><br>The year is 768AD and, after the death of his father, Charlemagne is to share the Frankish throne alongside his brother. A situation that ill-befits a man of his vision, and their relationship clouds as he feels the fiery blood of his grandfather, Charles Martel, stir in his veins.<br><br>Friends, enemies and opportunity populate a continent tired of conflict, the people eager for peace. Charlemagne finds himself at the head of a new age of education, religion and warfare, and sees all as tools to unite, stabilise… and expand. <br><br>The Saxons, the Saracens and the Vikings will all have something to say to a man of such ambition. <br>It will take guile, charm, intelligence and ruthlessness to succeed above all others. <br>Charles the Great, King of the Franks, the Father of Europe.<br>Will you make your mark in his image, or will you become your own king? <br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/343464/extras/event_pics.png?t=1522079361"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag"">A Unique Campaign with New Gameplay Mechanics</h2><br>Age of Charlemagne is an epic expansion for Total War: ATTILA, set in the Middle Ages on an sprawling new campaign map of Europe. <br>There have been kings and kingdoms before, but this is a time where truly great men united entire nations, built lasting legacies and defined what it meant to be a king. Can you be counted amongst them?<br><br>You’ll face a new age, but an exhausted world, weary of conflict and battle. New technologies and new ways of waging war will only get you so far. A good king is a shrewd man, who knows precisely how far his people can be pushed.<br>Do not mistake a reluctance to go to war as a sign that a nation is unprepared for it. Europe remains a melting pot of conflicting ideologies and long held distrust. While the old Empire is now a fading memory, the threats and consequences of its passing echo, resonating in new dangers and pressures for fledgling nations.<br>Opportunity presents itself in tying together vast new kingdoms, powerful new states that can be marshalled under a banner of civilisation drawn from ashes. Greatness awaits you, if you have the steel and vision of Charlemagne.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">New Campaign Map and UI</h2><br>The brand new Age of Charlemagne Campaign map is focussed in on Europe from the year 768AD. With 52 conquerable provinces, it provides a detailed and vibrant geopolitical starting position, offering hundreds of hours of potential gameplay.<br>The User Interface is now resplendent in a style inspired by the art of the Middle Ages.

In battle, he has the power to inspire his men in ways few leaders can.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Avars</h2><br>Accomplished horsemen, the barbarian Avars are quick to gain experience in the saddle; a powerful advantage in quick strike tactics and reflected in the wide variety of horse archers and lancers they have at their disposal.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Emirate of Cordoba</h2><br>A progressive Islamic society, The Emirate of Cordoba prides itself on its academic institutions, and explores new technologies at an enhanced rate. The Grand Vizier is respected by his people, ensuring a good level of public order.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Kingdom of Asturius</h2><br>Founded on the Iberian Peninsula by the Visigothic noble Pelagius, the Kingdom of Asturius blends a modern Romano-Christian outlook with classic barbarian military prowess, making their armies adept ambushers.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Kingdom of Mercia</h2><br>With the city of Lichfield as its capital, Mercia has risen to become the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Its military is popular and well-funded, and captives taken in battle will gladly join the Mercian ranks.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Kingdom of the Danes</h2><br>Peerless seafarers and adept raiders, The Danes excel at war on land or sea. Woe betide the merchant who plies his trade in the northern oceans – such routes are the Danes’ bread and butter.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Kingdom of the Lombards</h2>Originating as a Scandinavian tribe generations before, the Lombards have travelled long and far to establish their kingdom in Italy. Rich and influential, they raise much capital and levy many troops from tributary states.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Westphalia</h2><br>Remaining true to their Germanic barbarian roots, Westphalia maintains a well-armed military whose loyalty is assured in the crucible of battle. Much of its income is raised through raiding surrounding territories.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">New Units</h2><br>Age of Charlemagne includes all new units to better reflect the advancing warfare of the period, characterised by more heavily armed and armoured infantry and an increasing prevalence of cavalry of all categories, especially the emergence of knights in the Norman style for the first time.<br>With over 300 new units, you will have the opportunity to recruit iconic military forces of the period, such as Thegns, Fyrd Axemen, Scola Knights, Berber Jinetes, Gazehounds and the feared Seax-armed Saxon warriors.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/343464/extras/unit_parts.png?t=1522079361"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag"">War Weariness</h2><br>The sign of a great true king is in knowing how far your people can be pushed.

The fewer wars you wage the better your people will respond, as frequent and drawn out conflict will rapidly damage morale and your armies’ integrity.<br>A shrewd ruler will seek to bring peace quickly and decisively.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Unique Kingdom and Story Events</h2><br>Each playable faction has a unique set of challenging ‘Kingdom’ requirements to meet for the dedicated and shrewd player. Once achieved, you will be able to declare a new Kingdom name for your faction, reflecting or altering history in your wake.<br>In addition, each faction will receive tailored narrative Story Events, offering you distinct challenges and dilemmas as your Campaign unfolds.

This provides greater choices in how you develop and specialise them over time.<br>Finally, the new Army and Navy Legacies will focus on bonuses that reward distinct playstyles."

As specialists, Celtic nations should not be expected to perform as all-rounders; an experienced commander will play to their strengths with deadly effect.<br><br>Befitting their skilful application of these traits, sacking, looting and raiding are key sources of income for the Celts and this is reflected in many aspects of their gameplay style and the additional bonuses they receive. <br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/343461/extras/steam_banner_faction_leaders.png?t=1522079356"" ><br><br>Ebdanians <br>Alongside the common Celtic traits for raiding, the Ebdanians also have a talent for sacking and looting that combined gives them a unique playstyle and unrivalled potential for profiting bloodily at their enemies’ expense. <br><br>Picts <br>As ‘Children of the Night’, the Picts rightfully earn their reputation as skilled nocturnal combatants at land and sea, and may always choose to attack at night.

Occupying the island called 'Hibernia' by the Greeks and Romans, they were first recorded in the Greco-Egyptian writer Ptolemy's 2nd century AD treatise on 'Geography'. Making their home on the eastern shores, the tribe settled between two river estuaries - the Buvinda and Oboca, approximately where the city of Dublin now lies.<br><br>Relationships between clans is what drove barbarian culture and society, as clans intermarried, traded and warred with one another. Tribal life in Gaelic Ireland revolved around the clan, an extended family built on kinship, loyalty and, generally, a common ancestry. Hibernian clans were supposed to have been descended from one man, the authority to rule passing down the male bloodline. This means that most clansmen were of the same blood, although fostering and adoption were as common as in other parts of the world. Clans were led by their chieftain, who sat at the top of a strict hierarchical social structure.<br><br>Much like the Picts of Caledonia, the tribes of Hibernia have never been conquered by the Roman Empire, though they have traded with it - as evidenced by the discovery of Roman coins across the island. From their well-positioned, defensible capital the Ebdanians control their own destiny; they could rise to rule over the Celtic world, and none on these fair isles - or beyond - will be able to deny them!<br><br>Caledonians<br>The Caledonians are northern Britannia's first line of defence against Imperial Rome, and bar the way north for any would-be invaders. Although their true heritage has been much debated, they are believed to be an amalgamation of Pictish tribes and those fleeing the Roman advance into Britannia, surviving mostly in a series of hillforts and farms stretching across the highlands of Scotland.<br><br>Unfortunately, most historical sources on the Caledonians are of Roman origin, with the usual Roman bias in the reporting; for instance, Tacitus refuses to use terms such as 'king' to describe the Caledonian leader Calgacus, although this may be because he was unsure of their internal hierarchy. They are first mentioned by Tacitus as fighting at the Battle of Mons Graupius, which they lost once the Legions forced them from the hills into an open field battle, as opposed to the guerrilla-style tactics naturally favoured by the rocky terrain. In mentioning the Caledonians, Tacitus also describes them as the stereotypical definition of red haired, long-limbed “northmen” - furious and barbaric to a man.<br><br>In the centuries following Mons Graupius, the Caledonians have remained a belligerent thorn in the Empire's side, constantly crossing into Britannia to raid - and often successfully. Despite dogged Imperial efforts, they steadfastly refuse to be cowed, and stand now against a darkening world, poised to take back what is rightfully theirs!<br><br><br>Picts<br>The Picts are resolute defenders of their homeland, which lies at the far north of the Britannic Isles. The Romans tried for many years to bring them under control - the Emperors Hadrian and Antoninus even resorting to building walls across the country in order to control the passage of, and trade between, Imperial subjects and the savage, tenacious &quot;northmen&quot;. The  general focus on defence during Hadrian's tenure has led some to the notion that his wall was more than a mere trade gateway - it was intended to keep the Picts and other Caledonian peoples out.<br><br>Broadly, the Picts remain an enigmatic people who left no written records behind. However, we know they fought hard and against the invaders because the Roman historian Tacitus made specific references to their defiance in his 'Histories'. It is also likely that 'Picti' (in Latin) was simply a general term used by the Romans for any number of northern tribes whom they considered &quot;painted ones&quot;, in reference to the common Celtic tribal custom of tattooing and painting the body before battle.<br><br>The Picts were part of the ill-fated Great Conspiracy of AD367-368, when barbarian raids were co-ordinated with the desertion of the Roman garrison along Hadrian's Wall, and almost succeeded in wresting power from the Empire in Britannia and northern Gaul. Now, on the cusp of the 5th century AD, the Picts must rekindle old alliances if they wish to take their country back. Britannia, and indeed the Empire at-large, awaits the outcome - could this be the beginning of a unified Celtic empire in the north, one that will sweep away Roman oppression once and for all?"

Much like neighbouring Aksum, Himyar controls the flow of trade along major trade routes to the east. <br><br>The militaristic Himyarites relentlessly pursue their aims, particularly when facing the hated Aksumites. Himyar has even recently converted to Judaism, seemingly only to fuel the constant war that rages between them.

The Anteans, Sclavenians and Venedians may be used in Single or Multiplayer Campaign modes and Custom and Multiplayer battles. <br><br>A hardy and mobile people, The Slavs range far and wide across the blasted Steppe to recolonise and bring new life to abandoned earth. When conflict occurs, they release withering hails of poison arrows on their foes. Whether through diplomacy or conflict, they offer the perfect counter to the Hunnic threat, and introduce a number of unique ways to play Total War: ATTILA in both Campaign and Battle.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/428730/extras/SlavesProdPageLeaders.png?t=1522079835"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag"">New buildings and victory conditions </h2><br>Victory for the Slavic Nations requires the player to build Wonders from the new Legendary building chain. The scale of the victory (minor/regular/divine) and type of victory (military/cultural) depends upon the Wonder built, and players can continue to build different Wonders to achieve greater scales of victory.<br><br>These Wonders, while very expensive to build and maintain, confer increasingly powerful provincial and faction-wide bonuses, and unlock powerful new battle abilities for Slavic units.<br><br>The new City Religion building chain offers temples with numerous religious and civic bonuses, and unlocks the Last Stand battle ability for all Slavic units in the province.<br><br>The new Town Religion building chain offers temples which improve growth and fertility within the province. Combined with their cultural immunity to snow attrition, this enables Slavic nations to thrive more effectively as the climate cools.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/428730/extras/SlavesProdPageBuildings.png?t=1522079835"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Slavic Cultural Traits </h2><br>All factions in the Slavic cultural group benefit from the Hardy Warriors trait, which enables them to swiftly recolonise razed provinces. Hardy Warriors confers the following bonuses:<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Immunity from snow attrition<br></li><li>Zero colonisation cost <br></li><li>50% discount for all main settlement buildings.</li></ul><br>In addition, the new Zadruga building chain helps the Slavic nations to kickstart their economies in newly colonised regions. The chain offers a large base income at tier 1, and generates increased wealth from adjacent owned provinces. In brief, the Slavic nations can very quickly establish fresh colonies at no cost, and begin profiting from them immediately.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/428730/extras/SlavesProdPageAncillaries.png?t=1522079835"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Poison arrows</h2><br>A unique new ammunition type available only to Slavic factions, poison arrows are the deadliest arrow type in the game.  Poison arrows cause exhaustion to the target and generate damage over time. The Anteans can employ heavy poison arrows, with severely enhanced negative effects on their targets.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/428730/extras/SlavesProdPageEvents.png?t=1522079835"" ><br><br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Slavic Nations</h2></strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Anteans</h2><br>Often considered to be an off-shoot of the Venedians, the Anteans have nevertheless fought with savage fury, forging both independence and an identity of their own. Ironically, they were saved from Gothic subjugation by the advancing Huns, who forced the Goths westward before they were able to establish total dominance over the Slavs. The dawning of the 5th century AD promises nothing but further chaos; the Huns continue to maraud whilst the Roman Empire braces against them, desperately hoping to hold back the tide any way they can. Amidst this, the Anteans stand firm, determined to prove themselves strong, to emerge a unified Slavic power!<br><br>With a starting position adjacent to the Huns, the Roxolanians and the Quadians, Antean campaigns offer a significant challenge from the word go. Their faction trait also means that they must be mindful of battle terrain, and choose their engagements accordingly. As a result, Antean campaigns are rated Very Hard! <br><br>Faction trait: Liberty for Wolves<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>+20 morale, melee attack, melee defence, melee damage when fighting in forests<br></li><li>+20 morale, melee attack, melee defence, melee damage when fighting river battles<br></li><li>-10 morale, melee attack, melee defence, melee damage when fighting in grassland/open fields</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Venedians</h2><br>The true origins of the Venedians are shrouded in confusion, the Romans incorrectly classifying them as a Germanic people. With typical Roman snobbish arrogance, Ptolemy described their squalid living conditions and their &quot;repulsive&quot; appearance. Despite these scathing remarks, the Venedians have endured, becoming so populous that they have branched into two separate groups; Eastern Roman scholars make specific mention of the Venedians as the &quot;fathers&quot; of many of the other Slavic peoples. Although considered a guiding light in the gloom of the upcoming 5th century AD, the path ahead will not be easy - Huns, Romans and barbarians all encroach on Venedian territory. Yet if they can hold their nerve, and never cower to the mighty or the desperate, they may rise to inherit the world beyond!<br><br>Combining major farming bonuses with the Slavic Nations cultural trait, the Venedians excel at colonising and building their economy around algriculture. They also have a unique event chain which majorly improves their diplomatic relations with the Huns over time, making them well-placed to avoid the worst ravages of the apocalypse. <br><br>Faction trait: In Touch With The Ground<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Venedian farms carry no negative effects (squalor/public order)<br></li><li>+100% income from farms<br></li><li>-50% income from commerce, industry and culture</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Sclavenians</h2><br>The Sclavenians are an aggressive Slavic people who descended from the east, taking advantage of the thinly-spread Imperial armies and raiding Thrace and Illyricum - intent on finding both loot and a place to settle. Inevitably, this has drawn the ire of the beleaguered, but nevertheless still proud and mighty Roman Empire. Now, as the 4th century AD ebbs away, the 5th promises to be a time of unending challenges. Yet the Sclavenians are possessed of a fierce and irresistible temperament, showing time and time again that they are capable of mighty feats and that the future will be no different!<br><br>With a faction trait geared specifically towards slaying Nomad factions – and profiting well from it – the Sclavenians are the world’s best hope for defeating the Huns! <br><br>Faction trait: Horned Is The Hunter<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>+10 morale, melee damage, melee attack and melee defence when fighting Nomadic factions<br></li><li>Extra income for every unit destroyed<br></li><li>+5 Public Order from military presence</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Unit rosters</h2><h2 class=""bb_tag"">General</h2><br>Warlord's Guard<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Spearmen</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Slavic Levy Spearmen<br></li><li>Slavic Spearmen<br></li><li>Slavic Noble Spears<br></li><li>Slavic Large Shields<br></li><li>Chosen Shields</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Axe Infantry</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Slavic Axe Levy<br></li><li>Slavic Axemen<br></li><li>Slavic Axe Warriors<br></li><li>Perun's Axes<br></li><li>Slavic Ambushers<br></li><li>Followers of Veles (Venedians)<br></li><li>Veles Chosen (Venedians)<br></li><li>Horse Cutters (Sclavenians)<br></li><li>Horse Butchers (Sclavenians)</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Melee Infantry</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Slavic Warriors<br></li><li>Slavic Champions<br></li><li>Perun's Champions</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Bow Infantry</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Slavic Levy Archers<br></li><li>Slavic Archers<br></li><li>Slavic Hunters<br></li><li>Poison Archers (Anteans)<br></li><li>Poison Hunters (Anteans)</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Javelin Infantry</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Slavic Levy Skirmishers<br></li><li>Slavic Skirmishers<br></li><li>Slavic Noble Skirmishers</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Skirmish Cavalry</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Slavic Raiders<br></li><li>Slavic Horse Raiders<br></li><li>Svarog's Raiders</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Artillery</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Onager<br></li><li>Bastion Onager</li></ul>"

As the most southerly of the Norse kingdoms, they came into contact with the southern European peoples early on, treating them with an uncharacteristic openness. <br><br>After this, many left their lands to seek their fortunes elsewhere, returning with more than just gold. One recognised the potential of the Roman alphabet, adopting it to suit his native tongue and the writing materials available in the north. This led to the creation of the first runic alphabet, which rapidly spread across northern Europe, greatly enhancing the Nordic peoples’ culture and trade, resulting in the creation of objects combining both exotic resources and traditional Nordic styles.<br><br>However, neither wealth nor culture has dampened the Dani’s desire for conquest. Many northern tribes plunder foreign shores yet neglect their own; not so the Dani. Poised to take advantage of the ensuing upheaval, they strive to forge a grand Nordic empire to outlast that of Rome!<br><br><u>The Geats</u><br>Legendary ancestors of Beowulf, the Geati manifest all the intrepid boldness of the famous hero. From their stronghold on the southern tip of the Swedish peninsula they have naval access to the whole of northern Europe, allowing them to launch frequent raids without fear of retribution. The most glorious of these exploits are told in the Geati’s rich oral tradition, immortalising their leaders and inspiring a new generation to seek glory.<br><br>While the arrival of the Huns in Europe has meant disaster for most, for the Geati it is just another opportunity. Recently their king, Gizur, led a force into central Europe to fight alongside the Goths in exchange for Roman gold and goods – there are rich pickings to be gained fighting for the highest bidder in the south. Crisis is blooming in these fertile lands, and the Geati are determined to be at its heart, profiting from it.<br><br><u>The Jutes</u><br>The ocean laps the coasts of Juteland, summoning its inhabitants to new adventures and conquests. As such, the Juti have always been the most intrepid of the Norse-speaking peoples, looking to distant shores or clashing over the sparse northern lands. Accordingly, they are in the perfect position to profit from the slow collapse of Roman Britannia, and relentlessly plunder its coast as its defenders dwindle in number.<br><br>The Juti leadership use the spoils of their raids to make exquisite, prestige goods. Should the Juti succeed in conquering Britannia, many more will no doubt be forged. A successful conquest would be a great undertaking, and one requiring them to draw on the very depths of their fortitude. <br><br>To drive out the remaining Romans, subdue the belligerent locals, and foil the ambitions of their Saxon neighbours who also covet this green and pleasant land – the Juti have vowed no less!<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/335020/extras/landing_banner.png?t=1522075157"" >"

By the first century AD however, the Burgundii were active in mainland Europe. As the centuries progressed, they solidified their position as a power in the north and east of the continent. Although defeated by the Romans and surrounded by enemies, as the 4th century begins and the authority of the Western Roman Empire wanes, many tribes have pushed further into former imperial territory. As such the Burgundii now have the chance to move across The Rhine and take their rightful place there – in a world free from the shackles of Imperial Rome!<br><br><strong>Alamans</strong><br>As the spirited successors of the Suebi the Alemanni intend to forge a new life for their people away from the nomadic terror of the Huns and their ilk. Regarding themselves as Rome’s nemesis despite several defeats – notably at the battle of Lake Benacus – they have nevertheless stripped the empire of much of its western territory and have the collective will to carry on the fight. Led by a tribal confederation of greater and lesser kings, princes and chiefs who claim royal blood, the Alemanni levy a diverse range of Germanic troops to fight for them. Their destiny, however troubled, lies in greatness beyond The Rhine; their tenacity and sheer bloody-minded determination will see their ambition realised!<br><br><strong>Langobards</strong><br>When the small yet noble Winili tribe faced the vandals, their god Godan declared he would give victory to the tribe he saw first on the day of battle. Seeing the Winili with their women warriors, he asked “who are these long beards?” and awarded them victory. The tribe were from then on known as the Langobardi. Now they live along the river Elbe, far from their roots. Led by their king, who shares power with his people wherever possible, they are a determined tribe who have weathered many storms to achieve greatness. Langobardi history is marked by struggle and bloody conflict, and their future doubtless holds more of the same. Yet the Longobardi will emerge victorious, with renewed strength, to face anything the gods can throw at them!"

The Black Sea Colonies bring a rich new gameplay flavour to ROME II through their unique traits, battlefield units and buildings, and hybrid unit-rosters.<br><br><strong>Black Sea Colonies Cultural traits:</strong><br>Greek Knowledge: +5% to research rate <br>Far from Home: +2 cultural conversion<br><br><strong><u>Cimmeria</u></strong><br><br><strong>Background:</strong><br>The Cimmerian Bosporus has been fought over for its resources and strategic importance for millennia. The adventurous Greeks of Miletus, in Asia Minor, formed several colonies around the Black Sea coast during the 6th and 7th centuries BC in order to exploit its resources for trade with the wider Greek world. By the beginning of the 5th century BC their government had gravitated from classical Greek democracy to control by a single family. The current ruler, Satyrus, conquered nearby Greek cities, heralding the birth of the Cimmerian Kingdom, and a dynasty of rulers that endures to this day. Despite this strength, Cimmeria remains under threat from the surrounding nomadic tribes, and from the avaricious gaze of nearby Pontus, whose military strength may yet prove its undoing.<br><br><strong>Faction Traits:</strong><br>Tyrants: +5% corruption <br>Bosporian Fertile Lands: +25% wealth from agricultural buildings<br>Multiculturalism: -25% unhappiness from all foreign cultures in own territories<br><br><strong>New units:</strong><br>Scythian Hoplites: Armed in the Greek style with spear and shield, these medium infantry are solid defenders.<br><br>Cimmerian Heavy Archers: A truly multirole unit, these heavily-armoured archers trade their bows for spears when the enemy draws close.<br><br>Cimmerian Noble Infantry: Noble Infantry are drilled to a peerless standard in the classic hoplite style.<br><br>Picked Peltasts: Accurate and determined, these javelin-armed skirmishers can pack a devastating punch.  <br><br><strong>Unit roster:</strong><br>Greek/Scythian hybrid<br><br><strong>Unique Buildings:</strong><br>Prytaneion<br>Rose Marl Building<br>Sanctuary of Demeter<br><br><strong><u>Pergamon</u></strong><br><br><strong>Background:</strong><br>Although a minor player up to that point, Pergamon came to prominence during the struggle of Alexander the Great’s Successors for control of his fragmented empire. An ambitious lieutenant named Philetaerus acquired control over the fortress city and led Pergamon into a new golden age of culture and learning, building an impressive acropolis and a temple to Pergamon’s patron goddess, Athena. Not yet a kingdom in the truest sense, the time is right for expansion beyond its current borders.  There are also new threats to be faced from Galatia, the duplicitous Pontus and Cappadocia.

Around the 6th century BC, Greek traders from Militus arrived to construct a thriving mercantile economy from this former Persian satrapy. Its current ruler controls a powerful Greek trading state with strong Scythian influences and a nobility who extol the finest qualities of both cultures. His warriors fight in the Greek fashion, yet the ferocity of their nomadic past is very much alive. As such, Colchis has set out to conquer much of the land around it - to absorb further Scythian tribes, and as many former-Persian lands as possible, into his burgeoning empire.<br><br><strong>Faction traits:</strong><br>Trade Crossroads: +15% trade income <br>Golden Legacy: Major diplomatic penalty with Greek factions <br>Assimilation: +4 happiness from presence of other cultures<br><br><strong>New units:</strong><br>Colchian Nobles: Heavily armoured and drilled to blunt the mightiest charge, Colchian Nobles are a force to be reckoned with.<br><br><strong>Unit roster:</strong><br>Greek/Eastern hybrid<br><br><strong>Unique Buildings:</strong><br>Temple of the Golden Fleece<br>Trade Centre"
74012bd2-31f8-42cb-8962-d8eaaa96493d,"Total War: ROME II - Caesar in Gaul Campaign Pack","<strong>Total War™ ROME II: Caesar in Gaul</strong><br><br><strong>Campaign Pack</strong><br><br><strong>Description:</strong><br><br>Caesar in Gaul is a standalone campaign pack for Total War: ROME II covering Julius Caesar’s war of expansion against the Gaulish tribes. Players can choose from four playable factions in this conflict: the Gallic Arverni, the Germanic Suebi, the Belgic Nervii and Rome, in a campaign inspired by Caesar’s Commentarii de bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic war).<br><br>Offering a tighter scope in terms of time and geography than Rome II (58-51BC), the Caesar in Gaul Campaign Map is an expanded, more detailed vision of Gaul and the south coast of Britannia. <br><br>Compared with ROME II’s map of Gaul, Caesar in Gaul contains more regions and provinces, more factions (both playable and non-playable), and a series of famous generals and statesmen from history which the player will employ or fight against depending on their chosen faction. <br><br>A war of great profit and glory for Caesar, this conflict made him extremely popular with the people of Rome… though less so with the senators, who saw him gathering power to himself in a series of events that ultimately lead to his ascension to Dictator.<br><br>Caesar in Gaul differs from the core ROME II experience in a number of important ways:<br><br><strong>New Campaign Map:</strong><br><br>The Caesar in Gaul campaign map is an enhanced, more detailed representation of Gaul, with players able to expand across 18 provinces dotted with resources, new settlements and new provincial capitals.<br><br><strong>Greater focus on characters:</strong><br><br>Many factions employ great generals and statesmen from history (for example, Rome fields Gaius Julius Caesar himself, Mark Anthony and others). Each of the four playable factions also has a faction leader who acts as the player’s avatar during the campaign. <br><br><strong>24 turns per year:</strong><br><br>As Caesar in Gaul deals with a considerably shorter time-span (58-51BC) than the grand sweep of the ROME II campaign, each turn represents two weeks rather than a year. This means seasons make a return. The gameplay effects of these aren’t always predictable however, and may vary from province to province. A late autumn may bring a good harvest for example, but a long, dry summer may damage your food production.<br><br><strong>Compact, focussed multiplayer campaign:</strong><br><br>For those generals looking for a more rapid MP campaign game, Caesar in Gaul presents a series of interesting options. Due to the geographic scope and the opposing 48 factions, co-op or competitive 2-player campaigns are tighter, more focussed, and less time-consuming than a full Campaign. <br><br><strong>New mid-game challenge mechanics:</strong><br><br>For those players making it through to the mid-game, there will be new challenges to face as a more suitable replacement for the Civil Wars of ROME II. As a Gallic tribe, you’ll feel the mailed fist of Rome respond with heavy intervention forces, and as Rome, you’ll see the Gallic tribes rebelling and forming alliances against you.<br><br><strong>New historical battle:</strong><br><br>Caesar in Gaul adds the Battle of Alesia as a playable historical battle. Alesia marked the turning point of Caesar’s Gallic War, and resulted in the capture of Vercingetorix, who was later taken to Rome and executed at Caesar’s Triumph. <br><br>Set from Caesar’s perspective, Alesia tasks the player with maintaining the siege of Vercingetorix's Gallic stronghold. The battle begins with the Roman forces deployed within their own investment fortifications outside the hill-fort. The player must guide the Romans as they weather attacks from both a huge relief army and within the fort itself.<br><br><strong>New Total War: ROME II full campaign playable factions:</strong><br><br>Alongside the factions playable within the new Campaign, Caesar in Gaul also adds three new playable factions to the main game; they are:<br><br>•	Nervii (barbarian, Belgic)<br>The most fierce and powerful of the Belgic tribes, the Nervii are a melting pot of Celtic and Germanic heritage. Their unit roster reflects this mix of cultures, opening up the possibility of creating new, unique army compositions.<br><br>•	Boii (barbarian, Gallic)<br>One of the largest of the Gallic tribes, the Boii occupied Cisalpine-Gaul, Pannonia, Bohemia and Transalpine Gaul. Their numbers make them a force to be reckoned with but they are somewhat disconnected from other the Gallic tribes geographically and are directly exposed to the ferocious Germanic clans and the Dacians.<br><br>•	Galatians (barbarian, Anatolia)<br>The Gauls of the East, the Galatians migrated to Asia Minor following the Celtic invasion of the Balkans. They arrived through Thracia at around 270 BC, led by generals Lotarios &amp; Leonnorios. As Celts deep within Hellenic territory and factions hostile towards them, the Galatians offer interesting and challenging new gameplay.<br><br><strong>New units:</strong><br><br>Alongside their usual unit rosters, the playable factions of Caesar in Gaul (and playable factions in the main ROME II campaign provided by Caesar in Gaul ownership) also gain the following new units:  <br><br><strong>Boii (ROME II)</strong><br><br>•	Sword Followers (sword infantry)<br>Where a lord commands, the sword is thrust.<br><br>•	Veteran Spears (spear infantry)<br>Battle hardens the sinews and the heart, and deafens the ear to the cries of cowards.<br><br><strong>Galatians (ROME II)</strong><br><br>•	Galatian Legionaries (sword infantry)<br>The Celts have taught the Romans more than they're prepared to admit, but this is a two-way street.<br>•	Galatian Raiders (javelin and sword cavalry)<br>Broken enemies know it is better to flee than face riders who will not spare their lives.<br><br><strong>Gallic tribes (ROME II and Caesar in Gaul)</strong><br><br>•	Chosen Swordsmen (sword infantry)<br>These men fight with proven bravery and well-honed skill-at-arms.<br>•	Chosen Spearmen (spear infantry)<br>Chainmail does not chill a warrior's heart, or still his lust for battle.<br>•	Gallic Hunters (stealth bow infantry)<br>The skills of the hunt, hiding and a sudden strike, are the skills of a warrior.<br><br><strong>Nervii (ROME II and Caesar in Gaul)</strong><br><br>•	Fierce Swords (sword infantry)<br>Once he has earned it, a Celt will only be parted from his longsword by death itself.<br>•	Guerilla Swordsmen (stealth sword infantry)<br>•	These swordsmen strike wherever and whenever their enemies least expect.<br>•	Mighty Horse (spear cavalry)<br>A strong mount and a savage swing make these warriors a fearsome prospect.<br>•	Naked Spears (spear infantry)<br>Who needs clothes when you have more than your share of courage?<br>•	Gallic Hunters (stealth bow infantry)<br>The skills of the hunt, hiding and a sudden strike, are the skills of a warrior.<br><br><strong>Auxiliaries</strong><br><br>•	Auxiliary Gallic Hunters (stealth bow infantry)<br>The skills of a hunter should be used in the service of Rome.<br>•	Auxiliary Noble Horse(spear cavalry) <br>A mounted, armoured fist is always useful in a Roman army.<br>•	Auxiliary Naked Swords (sword infantry)<br>The savage gods of war should be used to Rome's advantage.<br>•	Auxiliary Short Swords (sword infantry)<br>Bravery in battle, rather than skill, sometimes gives worth to a man.<br><br><strong>Mercenaries</strong><br><br>•	Mercenary Gallic Hunters (stealth bow infantry)<br>The hunting of other men often has the greatest of rewards.<br>•	Mercenary Noble Horse (spear cavalry) <br>Even a nobleman has his price, and will fight for gold.<br>•	Mercenary Naked Swords (sword infantry)<br>The gods of war will bless mercenaries as long as they fight bravely.<br>•	Mercenary Short Swords (sword infantry)<br>It is often enough to sell bravery and a taste for glory."

These are Rome, Gallic Rome, Palmyra, the Sassanids and the Gothi. Heroic factions have grander and more elaborate victory conditions, and unique named faction leaders who cannot die in battle.<br><br>Heroic factions also have their own flavourful and bespoke event-chains, representing the tales of these characters’ lives, which bring bonuses to their abilities and enable the player to make meaningful choices regarding their development and that of their faction.<br><br><strong>New events, dilemmas and missions</strong><br>Empire Divided brings a host of new events, dilemmas and missions, both general and faction-specific, to introduce new challenges, benefits and period flavour to your campaigns. <br><br><strong>Banditry</strong><br>This period of reduced governmental authority fosters the spread of Banditry. Each province now has a variable Banditry level which increases with the size of your domain and the presence of certain local buildings. Banditry can be reduced with the presence of armies, generals and special buildings. As Banditry grows, food levels fall, threatening faction-wide shortages. High provincial Banditry can also trigger special Bandit events to occur. <br><br><strong>Plagues</strong><br>Devastating diseases were commonplace in the 3rd century. When a plague hits a settlement it hampers growth, impacts public order and reduces income. Diseases can move between neighbouring territories, spreading with army movement and along trade routes. Sanitation buildings can prevent plagues from erupting and spreading, and key technologies can improve sanitation factionwide.<br><br><strong>Cults</strong><br>Alongside the more established religions, many cults sprang up in the 3rd century. These are represented by special building chains that can be constructed by any faction in any settlement. Three different cults are available in the game: Christianity, Mithraism and Manichaeism.<br><br>A cult building may be built for no cost, as its construction represents your empire permitting disciples to settle within your territory. This makes cult bonuses relatively easy to obtain, though cults spread foreign culture, bringing disorder into your provinces. In order to remove a cult building, a significant expenditure is required and a public order penalty is incurred required as this is considered persecution. Careful consideration of a cult’s benefits and disadvantages is required but, if used correctly, they can become a powerful tool.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>New General Skills</strong></h2>Generals’ skill have been overhauled, and now allow the player to customise and specialise their characters in the disciplines of Recruitment, Combat, Strategy, Governance and Maritime Proficiency.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>New Narrative Technologies</strong></h2> All technology trees have been restructured and redesigned to reflect the time-period and each of the game’s culture groups. Moreover, technologies in Empire Divided don’t represent scientific or technological breakthroughs; rather they represent the measures taken by rulers to deal with specific problems facing their empires. In this way, they help to tell the story of each faction’s journey through the period. This is especially true for the Heroic factions:<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Aurelian’s technologies chart the journey of an emperor who must reform the military, then unify and defend his empire. <br></li><li>Zenobia’s technologies tell the story of her rise to power.<br></li><li>Tetricus’ technologies reveal his Republican political views in an age of fractured empire.<br></li><li>Hormizd’s technologies portray him as a ruler living up to the image of his predecessors, the great kings of the past.<br></li><li>Cannonades’ technologies tell a tale of Gothic bloodlust, and the many challenges his people must overcome in order to unify and persevere.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Updated building chains</strong></h2> <br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Rome features a new Administration building, which deals with tax collection, agent improvement and countering banditry<br></li><li>Naval Training buildings can now be constructed in the capital of a coastal province providing bonuses to ship recruitment <br></li><li>Palmyra gains a new religious building chain that is dedicated to the gods Baalshamin, Aglibol, Yarhibol, Malakbel and Nabu<br></li><li>Armenia gains a new religious building chain that is dedicated to Christianity<br></li><li>Several new unique buildings are available to selected factions. These are Rome (the Grand Temple of Sol Invictus), Palmyra (the Great Colonnade, the El Kanat irrigation system and the Grand Temple of Baal), Sassanids (the Grand Statue of Shapur I) and Armenia (the Etchmiadzin cathedral -  historically, the world’s first Christian cathedral)</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>New Units</strong></h2><br>Alongside the existing unit rosters from ROME II, Empire Divided introduces a number of unique and signature units for every faction. Each faction features its own variant style and unique take on the classic Roman look and feel, with Aurelian’s Roman forces bearing the closest resemblance to the classic template. Unique Roman units are:<br><br><strong>Rome</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Legionaries<br></li><li>Heavy infantry units – Praetorians, Jovianii, Herulianii<br></li><li>Equites Dalmatarum – famous light cavalry<br></li><li>Clibanarii and Cataphractarii – very heavy cavalry, precursors to medieval knights</li></ul><br><strong>Gallic Rome</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Taifali Cavalry – famous associated barbarian cavalry (distinguishing shield designs)<br></li><li>Gallic Legionaries – distinctive from Roman Legionaries<br></li><li>Gallic Axemen and Longswords</li></ul><br><strong>Palmyrene Rome</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Palmyrene Legionaries – distinctive armour and a preference for spears<br></li><li>Hamian Archers – famous middle-eastern foot soldiers<br></li><li>Palmyrene Cataphracts – eastern-looking heavy cavalry<br></li><li>Armoured Camels – exotic eastern-style cavalry</li></ul><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/694880/extras/4.ED_Fighting_2.jpg?t=1522079821"" >"

However, they are defined by their fierce independence and between them demonstrate a huge variety in approach to civil and military challenges that often brings them into conflict with the wider world, and each other.<br><br>New Features:<br><br>New Playable Factions – Athens, Epirus and Sparta each offer a unique new way to experience the campaign, with their own rosters of powerful military units, distinct traits and play styles.<br>The Athenian pursuit of enlightenment grants them technological and cultural bonuses; Sparta’s dominance over the Helots allows them to maintain a larger slave population; and Epirus enjoys bonuses to settlement exploitation stemming from their village-confederation origins.<br><br>New Cultural Traits – All Greek States benefit from a bonus in battle when defending their own or an allied territory, a bonus to wealth generated by their capitals and an increase to the rate of cultural conversion within their borders.<br><br>New Cultural Objectives – Greek States have their own new set of military, economic and cultural victory conditions, as well as sharing a unique set of bonus objectives drawn from Greek history. Additionally, each faction will have to contend with its unique events and dilemmas.<br><br>New Military Traditions – Each of the Greek States has a unique top-tier military tradition: Athenian fleets may be honoured as Children of the Aegaean, improving the ramming ability of their ships whilst allowing them to secure more income when raiding; Spartan armies may be remembered as Peers of Leonidas, improving their melee defense capabilities and reducing their upkeep; the armies of Epirus may be feared as Hounds of Molossus, granting them greater charge bonuses whilst allowing them to keep public order problems in check.<br><br>New Units:<br><br>In addition to the intimidating unit rosters of each faction now playable for the first time, the Greek States Culture Pack introduces a variety of unique and especially elite and deadly forces.<br><br>Mercenary Veteran Hoplites – [available to all playable factions]<br>From glistening spear points to earth-shaking tread, a phalanx is a sight and sound to inspire dread.

In many ways, Greek culture is defined by Athens. Its military focus has long been its navy; however, continuing the traditions of the classical era, its citizens are also expected to contribute both infantry and cavalry to its armies.<br><br>Epirus <br>Epirus is a Greek kingdom formed of numerous small villages and towns, rather than the great cities of the south. An agriculture and fishing-based society, Epirus nevertheless maintains a balanced army on the Alexandrian model, consisting of cavalry, archers, peltasts, phalangites and war elephants. They also make extensive use of mercenaries from throughout the Greek-speaking world.<br><br>Sparta <br>With every aspect of their lives and society geared towards warfare, Sparta dominated the Greek world and continues to produce arguably the finest soldiers of the Hellenic period. The slaves and non-citizens of Sparta enable their citizens to pursue warrior perfection as soldiers and champions. Trained and hardened in battle, their warriors and leaders are the embodiment of military discipline and virtue."
a3ce2a81-6aca-428c-b0ac-d2f04346dbe7,"Total War: ROME II - Hannibal at the Gates Campaign Pack","<strong>Total War™: ROME II – Hannibal at the Gates</strong><br><br>Dropping you into the Western Mediterranean at the outbreak of the 2nd Punic War, Hannibal at the Gates features a new campaign map focused on the period that brought the ancient-world superpowers of Rome and Carthage to all-out war.  <br><br>One of the most famous in history, the conflict demonstrated the tactical genius of great rival generals Scipio and Hannibal. Can you recreate their remarkable strategies, or can you do better? How will you change history?<br><br>You enter the war as Carthage or Rome, command the noble Hellenic city-state of Syracuse, or, for the first time in ROME II, play an Iberian faction as the Arevaci or the Lusitani.<br><br><strong>Hannibal at the Gates also features:</strong><br><br><i>New Campaign Map:</i><br><br>A more detailed representation of the western Mediterranean than the ROME II map, with players able to expand across 19 provinces dotted with resources and settlements. The major powers of the time, Rome and Carthage, begin at loggerheads but with a number of key regions and client states under their control. Syracuse, the Arevaci and the Lusitani all start with a single region, offering a significantly different and more formidable challenge than playing as one of the two great empires.<br><br><i>Diplomacy-focused Technology:</i><br><br>Rome and Carthage both feature new civil tech-tree branches focused on diplomacy. Both sides begin with multiple allies and client states, and can undermine their opponents’ support by diplomatic means.<br><br><i>12 Turns per-year:</i><br><br>With a time period covering events between 218 - 202BC, each turn in Hannibal at the Gates represents a month, and the campaign transitions through all four seasons of the year, complete with seasonal gameplay effects.<br><br><i>Compact, focused Multiplayer Campaign:</i><br>For those generals seeking a more rapid Multiplayer Campaign game, Hannibal at the Gates’ tighter geographic scope makes co-op or competitive 2-player campaigns more focused and faster than a full Grand Campaign.<br><br><i>New Historical Battles:</i><br><br>Hannibal at the Gates adds two new Historical Battles: the Battle of Cannae (216BC) and the Battle of Zama (202BC). Both battles marked key points in the 2nd Punic War, with Cannae representing the high point of Hannibal's invasion of Italy, and Zama marking the completion of Rome's victory and dominance over Carthage.<br><br><i>New Playable Factions for Total War™: ROME II</i><br><br>In addition to mighty Carthage and Rome, players can fight the 2nd Punic War as three new factions: the Arevaci, the Lusitani and Syracuse, each one featuring its own faction traits, characteristics, unique units and campaign start-position. If Hannibal at the Gates is owned, these factions are also playable in the ROME II Grand Campaign.<br><br><i>The Arevaci </i><br><br>Imperialist expansion has brought both Carthage and Rome to the Arevaci's door, although it is Hannibal that currently shares a border with the warlike Celtiberian tribe. As the campaign begins, the Arevaci are neutral but have a clear choice before them: unite with Hannibal and risk genocidal retaliation from the Romans, or remain on good terms with Rome and face the certainty of Carthaginian wrath. Despite their knowledge of the terrain and superb fighting prowess, the Arevaci cannot take on both superpowers at once. For now, they maintain their neutrality, but it cannot last. Someone must control the Iberian peninsula, could it be the Arevaci?<br><br><i>The Lusitani</i><br><br>The Lusitani lived in Iberia long before Carthage or Rome disturbed the region. They are, like their distant cousins the Suebi, not a single clan but a confederation of smaller tribes, working together for defensive and mutual gain Fierce and agile warriors, the Lusitani are well suited to guerrilla warfare. As Hannibal’s Carthaginian army marches through lands previously controlled by Rome, there is opportunity for the Lusitani to expand beyond their bounds and claim back Iberia from its invaders. However, though there may be prudence in caution, even fraternisation with the enemy at first, eventually they must be expelled from the land!<br><br><i>Syracuse </i><br><br>The city-state of Syracuse is renowned throughout the ancient world as a centre for culture and science. It is also rich; Syracuse benefits greatly from its prime position in the central Mediterranean. A string of tyrants dominate its history, defending the city's autonomy against fellow Greeks, Carthaginians and threats from within. In 218BC, both Rome and Carthage would like to see Syracuse under their control once and for all. As the two superpowers go to war again, it stands on a precipice - will Syracuse forge its own destiny or fall into obscurity as just another colonial possession?<br><br><i>New Units</i><br><br>Alongside their regular unit rosters, the playable factions in Hannibal at the Gates get the following new units. If you own Hannibal at the Gates, these units will also be available in the ROME II Grand Campaign:<br><br><strong>Arevaci </strong><br>• Painted Warriors (melee infantry)<br>Painted bodies and unpleasant stenches instil fear in unlucky opponents, which is half the battle.<br><br>• Celtiberian Cavalry (melee cavalry)<br>A versatile cavalry strike force when commanded by a skilled general.<br><br><strong>Lusitani  </strong><br>• Lusitani Guerrillas (stealth spear infantry)<br>Moving unseen to ambush their opponents, these stealthy guerrilla fighters are masters of their craft.<br><br>• Lusitani Spearmen (spear infantry)<br>Skilled tribal spearmen whose reputation on the battlefield is fully deserved.<br><br><strong>Syracuse </strong><br>• Picked Hoplites (elite hoplites, also available to Athens)<br>The cream of citizen hoplites to proudly defend their city from invasion.<br><br><strong>New Roman Auxiliary units:</strong><br>• Auxiliary Scutarii (Iberian melee infantry)<br>These Iberians are more than able to serve Rome at the front of a battle line.<br><br>• Auxiliary Scutarii Cavalry (Iberian melee cavalry)<br>These heavy cavalrymen add a touch of Iberian fire to otherwise conservative Roman ranks.<br><br><strong>New Iberian Mercenary units:</strong><br>• Mercenary Scutarii (Iberian melee infantry)<br>Large, well-paid men with falcatas can settle a surprisingly large number of arguments.<br><br>• Mercenary Scutarii Cavalry (Iberian melee cavalry)<br>These mounted mercenaries are a fine force for close-quarters combat.<br><br><strong>New Italian Mercenary units:</strong><br>• Mercenary Etruscan Hoplites (Italian hoplites)<br>Equipped and trained in the Greek fashion, Rome's former masters remain a force to be reckoned with.<br><br>• Mercenary Samnite Warriors (Italian heavy infantry)<br>Conquered peoples can still produce the finest warriors.<br><br>• Mercenary Campanian Cavalry (Italian heavy cavalry)<br>Noble horsemen from some of the finest pastures of the peninsula."

Accomplished raiders and legendary horsemen, the Nomadic Tribes are poised to sweep from the steppes and strike at the soft, sedentary targets of more established empires. <br><br>Defined by their independence, their excellence on horseback and their ability to swiftly assemble large armies, The Nomadic Tribes bring an entirely new cultural flavour to ROME II. <br><br><strong><u>New Features:</u></strong><br><br><strong>New Playable Factions</strong> – The Roxolani, Massagetae and Royal Scythians each offer a unique new way to experience the campaign, with their own rosters of powerful military units, distinct traits and play styles.<br><br>The Roxolani gain wealth from their skills as migrant traders, and as committed conquerors, fight harder when in enemy territory; the Royal Scythians are experts with the bow, and enjoy increased wealth through their high degree of craftsmanship; and the fierce independence of the Massagetae leads them to fight harder when defending their territory, while their expertise in animal husbandry means increased income from livestock.<br><br><strong>New Cultural Traits</strong> – All Nomadic Tribes benefit from extra recruitment slots in their home provinces, enabling them to raise armies swiftly. They have also refined raiding and looting to an art-form, and their forces gather greater wealth through raiding than other factions.<br><br><strong>New Cultural Objectives</strong> – The Nomadic Tribes have their own new set of military, economic and cultural victory conditions, as well as sharing a unique set of bonus objectives drawn from the history of The Steppes. Additionally, each faction will have to contend with its unique events and dilemmas.<br><br><strong>New Military Tradition</strong> – The armies of the Nomadic Tribes can benefit from a unique new military tradition: Nomadic Horde. This tradition increases the movement range of the army, increases its unit morale when fighting in enemy territory and, commensurate with the tribes’ heavy use of horse and rider, reduces the recruitment costs of cavalry units.<br><br><br><u><strong>New Units:</strong></u><br><br>Peerless horsemen and skilled archers, The Nomadic Tribes Culture Pack offers factions which rely heavily on cavalry for the backbone of their fighting horses. Among the numerous melee, bow, javelin and spear-armed riders of the steppes, the Nomadic Tribes Culture Pack also introduces a variety of unique and deadly mounted units.<br><br><strong>MASSAGETAE: armour focussed</strong><br><br><strong>Saka Noble Armoured Lancers</strong><br>Few can withstand a charge by these skilled and heavily-armoured noblemen.<br><br><strong>Saka Cataphracts </strong><br>Armoured from head to toe, these heavy cavalry are capable of flattening anyone in their path.<br><br><strong>Saka Cataphract Horse Archers </strong><br>Heavy armour and excellent bow-skills guide these natural riders to victory.<br><br><strong>ROXOLANI: melee focussed</strong><br><br><strong>Sarmatian Royal Lancers</strong><br>Deadly lances make these heavy cavalrymen a frightening – and deadly – force.<br><br><strong>Sarmatian Riders </strong><br>Born to the saddle, these spear-wielding riders like to get up-close and brutal with their enemies.<br><br><strong>Sarmatian Horsemen</strong><br>With the right man in the saddle, a horse and a spear make for a deadly combination.<br><br><strong>ROYAL SCYTHIANS: ranged-weapon focussed</strong><br><br><strong>Royal Horse Archers</strong><br>There are few more terrifying sights than Scythian horse-archers preparing to fire.<br><br><strong>Scythian Royal Skirmishers </strong><br>The enemies of Scythia rightly fear these natural riders’ javelins – and the swift swords which follow.<br>																														<br><strong><u>New Buildings:</u></strong><br><br>The Nomadic Tribes are fiercely independent and make lives for themselves under canvas. You’ll see this reflected in their settlements and cities on the campaign map, which favour tents and yurts over brick and stone structures. In addition, their building chains are unique among the factions of ROME II; they reflect the nomadic lifestyle and bring bonuses which play to the nomads’ strengths as shepherds, horsemen and archers. <br><br><strong>Food:</strong><br>Given their itinerant lifestyle, the Nomadic Tribes’ food supply – and to a greater degree than other factions, their income – begins with animal herding. As such, their food-production building chain begins with Sheep Pens, which advances to the Weaver, then the Yurt Maker.<br>A second Camp chain replaces farms in the standard building chains, and offers increasing benefits to the income that livestock bring. The Camp chain begins with the Nomad Camp, which upgrades to the Wagon Camp, then the Royal Camp. <br><br><strong>Research </strong><br>The wisest of the tribe gather with the soothsayers to devise ways of improving tribal society. The Nomadic Tribes’ Research chain consists of the Enaree Tent, which upgrades to the Enaree Conclave, and ultimately the Royal Enarees, and brings boosts to the rate at which new technologies are developed.<br><br><strong>Stables</strong><br>The people of the Nomadic Tribes make great use of horses for trade, travel and war, and breed their stock on the wide-open steppe. The Stables chain begins with Wild Horses, which upgrades to Large Herd and finally to the Royal Herd.<br><br><strong>Religion</strong><br>The tribes of the great steppe pray to their own gods, and these are reflected in the unique groves, shrines and sanctuaries they build. The building chains relating to each god bring bonuses to many aspects of nomadic development, such as research, livestock income, agent levels and public order. Certain chains also bring bonuses to two of the nomads’ key military units: melee cavalry and horse archers. <br><br>In addition, the apex of the religious chain brings access to a unique new wonder: The Kurgan Field. This giant burial mound boosts the cultural influence of the tribe, and brings a considerable boost to income through livestock.<br><br><strong><u>Faction History:</u></strong><br><br><strong>The Royal Scythians</strong><br>The Royal Scythians are the social and tribal elite of nomad society, their skills in war matched only by their love of gold and ostentatious personal finery. Any who mistake this golden luxury for decadence usually die on the points of Royal Scythian spears well before they can change their misguided opinion.<br><br><strong>The Massagetae</strong><br>The Massagetae are a confederation of tribes, and fierce steppe warriors all. Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, fell in battle against them while leading a Persian army deep into the steppes. They have remained a dangerous people ever since, feared and respected by their neighbours.<br><br><strong>The Roxolani </strong><br>Every man has his day in the sun, and the same is true of entire tribes. As the Scythians grow weak, the Roxolani are ready to take up the sword in their place. From astride their hardy steppe horses, they are right to see the whole of the ‘civilized’ world as being filled with riches. What glorious battles await?"

The map brings 12 new Wonders to light, including the Ruins of Troy, the Temple of Zeus and the Royal Tombs of Makedon. Furthermore, as the campaign features a tighter timeframe than the ROME II Grand Campaign, each turn represents one month.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/327280/extras/WoS_SteamBanner_factions.jpg?t=1522079815"" ><br><br><u>Four Playable Factions</u><br>Athens (Athenai), Corinth (Korinthos), Sparta and Boiotia are all playable in Wrath of Sparta, each bringing its own faction traits, unit rosters, challenges and geographical starting point.

Each choice can bring you favour or misfortune.

There are fewer but more specialised units of mercenaries available to swiftly bolster and bring greater flexibility to armies, and these are more widely available across the provinces.<br><br>The backbone of Greek naval assets is composed of tactical variations on the Dieres and Trieres hull types, with a greater focus on ramming and boarding. In addition, troop transports act more as cargo ships than combat vessels, and are no longer able to ram in naval battles, reducing the unfair advantage of troop convoys in naval warfare. This change will be retroactively applied to all ROME II campaigns.<br><br>Amongst over 50 new Naval and Land units for Wrath of Sparta, you will also encounter specialist and legendary troops, such as the Immortal Spearmen, Spartan Hoplites and Skiritai."

Beastmen Ambush is their standard mode of campaign map movement and enables the army to ambush enemy forces on the move. <br><br>The Hidden Encampment stance lets the army melt into the shadows and focus on their infrastructure and recruitment, invisible to all but the keenest-eyed enemy Lords.<br><br>Beast-Paths enables the army to ignore impassable terrain by following the secret paths known only to their kind. If an army is attacked in this stance, the ensuing battle will take place in one of the atmospheric new Beast Path battle-maps. <br><br>Like other races, The Beastmen can also enter the Raiding stance to harvest income, increase Bestial Rage and sow public disorder in enemy territory. <br><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/404012/extras/Cygor.png?t=1521822879"" ><br><br><br><strong>Unique post-battle options</strong><br>When a Beastmen army conquers an enemy settlement, the player gets two new post-battle options. Raze and Loot harvests income from the settlement before destroying it, while Raze and Defile razes the settlement and erects a blasphemous monument in its place. This generates major Chaos Corruption in the province and confers a large Population Growth bonus upon the horde. <br><br><strong>The Dark Moon rises!</strong><br>The Beastmen share a dark bond with Morrslieb, the Chaos Moon. As it waxes in the night sky, they are given to feats of drunken bacchanalia and ghastly sacrifice beneath its sickly gaze. When a periodic Full Moon event occurs in the Beastmen campaign game, the player must direct his Warherds in which twisted act to perform. There is often a price to be paid for such dark celebrations, but Morrslieb always rewards the faithful!<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Legendary Lords</strong></h2><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/404012/extras/Khazrak.png?t=1521822879"" ><br><br><br>A Beastmen Grand Campaign may be led by one of two Legendary Lords: the fearsome Beastlord Khazrak The One Eye, or the blasphemous Bray-Shaman, Malagor The Dark Omen. <br><br>Each has their own skill trees, abilities, quest-chains, legendary items, and Grand Campaign start positions. Khazrak begins the Grand Campaign in the Tobaro Region of Estalia, while Malagor begins play in The Marshes of Madness, deep in the Badlands.<br><br><strong>Khazrak The One Eye</strong><br>The bestial intelligence that seethes behind Khazrak’s one good eye makes him the paragon of Beastlords. Gifted with the patience and strategic shrewdness of the most accomplished generals, Khazrak wages the perfect guerrilla war, striking hard and fast where the enemy is weakest, then melting into the shadows to plan the next blow. The only Lord of men ever to best him is Boris Todbringer of Middenheim, who deprived him of an eye with a slash of his Runefang blade.<br><br>Now Khazrak is on the offensive once more. Warherd in tow, he stalks his nemesis through the twisted bowers of Drakland, intending to repay the courtesy in full. An eye for an eye!<br><br>As well as a Beastlord, Khazrak The One Eye is a powerful melee warrior with two quest-chains, rewarding him with the unique items Scourge and The Dark Mail. <br><br>Scourge is a vicious, barbed whip, wrapped in the bitter curses of countless generations of Bray-Shamans. In battle, Scourge improves Khazrak’s Melee Attack and Weapon Strength characteristics; on the Campaign Map, it reduces recruitment costs for Khazrak’s horde, intensifies the Chaos Corruption he generates and increases Khazrak’s post-battle loot amount.<br><br>The Dark Mail is an ancient coat of magical armour that enhances Khazrak’s Armour and Magical Resistance characteristics.<br><br>Khazrak has the abilities Missile Resistance (15%), Resilience, Encourage, Hide (Forest) and Primal Rage (see Unique Abilities below for details).<br><br>If you choose Khazrak The One Eye as your starting Legendary Lord, your race gains +10% income from Raiding and +5 leadership when fighting humans.<br><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/404012/extras/Campaign.png?t=1521822879"" ><br><br><br><strong>Malagor The Dark Omen</strong><br>To the Beastmen – and indeed, to the inhabitants of The Empire – Malagor is the fleshly incarnation of mankind’s demise. Unsurpassed in his grasp of The Lore of The Wild, the rites he performs are iniquitous enough to quail even the foulest of Bray-Shamans. When Malagor and his hordes descend upon a human settlement, he delights in sacrificing priests on the very altars they served. No act of blasphemy is too abhorrent, no desecration too foul, for Malagor The Dark Omen. <br><br>Malagor has a single quest-chain which rewards him with a unique item, The Icons of Vilification. This filth-encrusted collection of blasphemous relics – the skulls of dead priests, branches torn from the hallowed trees of Athel Loren, and more – reduces the recruitment cost and increases the rank of lesser Bray-Shamans. In battle, The Icons emit an aura that increases the damage output of those around Malagor.<br><br>Malagor has the abilities Missile Resistance (15%), Resilience, Encourage, Hide (Forest) and Primal Rage (see Unique Abilities below for details). Malagor can also unlock a unique skill at level 15: Something Wicked This Way Comes. This confers a permanent Hex spell on Malagor, causing -4 Leadership to nearby enemy units in battle and -3 Leadership to enemy armies in Malagor’s campaign map region.<br><br>If you choose Malagor The Dark Omen as your starting Legendary Lord, your faction can field +1 Bray-Shaman, and all your characters gain +5% movement range.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Lords</strong></h2><br><br>Warherds are commanded by Beastlords, the braying, stomping masters of their kind. Along with Campaign, Battle and Melee skill-trees unique to The Beastmen race, Beastlords also have a number of unique skill unlocks improving their melee attack, melee defence, leadership, weapon strength and missile resistance statistics, making them exceedingly powerful warriors as well as great leaders. Beastlords may also be mounted on Razorgor Chariots from rank 15 onwards.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Heroes</strong></h2><br><br>The Beastmen can recruit and field two unique Hero types. <br><br><strong>Gorebull</strong><br>Gorebulls are hulking, twin-horned melee specialists – the very mightiest examples of Minotaurs.

These culminate in powerful passive and active support skills, which enhance the campaign and battle capabilities of any horde they join.<br><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/404012/extras/GorebullSmall.jpg?t=1521822879"" ><br><br><br><strong>Bray-Shaman</strong><br>Bray-Shamans are spellcaster Heroes, capable of employing The Lore of Death, The Lore of Beasts, or the bestial school of magic known only to The Beastmen, The Lore of The Wild. This Lore boasts a variety of unique Hexes, Augments and Magic Missiles, but arguably its most powerful spell is Savage Dominion, which enables the Bray-Shaman to summon a Cygor directly into the thick of battle!<br><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/404012/extras/Bray-ShamanSmall.jpg?t=1521822879"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Battlefield units</strong></h2><br><br><strong>Unique Abilities</strong><br>Units in the Beastmen roster benefit from some unique passive abilities which confer benefits in combat.

In battle, they gain immunity to vigour-loss and a leadership bonus. If their morale begins to waver however, the Rowdy effect is lost.<br>Bloodgreed<br>The Minotaurs’ Bloodgreed makes them vicious combatants, and brings buffs to their Charge Bonus, Speed, Weapon Damage and Melee Attack characteristics.<br><br><strong>Soul Eater</strong><br>The towering bipedal Cygor feasts on the souls of wizards.

When he accompanies an army into battle, he typically rides atop the resplendent War Altar of Sigmar, inspiring the soldiers around him to great acts of heroism as he strikes the followers of evil down with powerful blows and words of divine force.

When necromantic magic is thick in the air, the bell tolls and ripples of Dark Magic emanate from the Corpse Cart. <br><br>As a magical support chariot, the Corpse Cart projects a magical aura known as the Vigor Mortis.

He has sworn an oath to reclaim the fallen Dwarf Hold from the Greenskin usurpers, despite the mountainous odds he faces.<br><br>Karak Eight Peaks represents more than Belegar’s birthright however. In terms of prestige and wealth it is second only to Karaz-a-Karak itself, and if Belegar can reclaim it in the name of Clan Angrund, he will gain access to the ancestral tombs and the rich trove of ancient and powerful rune-weapons which lies within…   <br><br><strong>Unique start-position</strong><br>Belegar begins the Grand Campaign with ownership of the walled settlement of Karak Izor in Border Princes territory.<br><br><strong>Campaign bonuses</strong><br>When chosen to lead a Grand Campaign, Belegar begins play with the spirits of his Ancestors as his companion Heroes. King Lunn The Ironhammer (Thane), Halkenhaf Stonebeard (Thane), Dramar Hammerfist (Master Engineer) and Throni Ironbrow (Runesmith) are Ethereal Heroes, with all the benefits the Ethereal trait provides. <br><br>Belegar gains early access to the new Dwarf Rangers through the Ranger Outpost building. He also has the Siege Attacker trait, enabling him to attack walled cities without building siege equipment first. Until he captures Karak Eight Peaks however, Belegar suffers increased unit upkeep costs to his army.<br><br><strong>Quests</strong><br>Belegar may embark on quests to attain his two legendary items, The Shield of Defiance, and the powerful ancestral rune-weapon The Hammer of Angrund.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Skarsnik, Warlord of The Eight Peaks</strong></h2><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/404014/extras/SkarsnikGIF3.jpg?t=1521822874"" ><br><br><br>Skarsnik is the chieftain of the Crooked Moon Tribe, and is widely acknowledged as the most powerful Night Goblin in the World’s Edge Mountains. This reputation was earned through devious machinations, relentless spite, and a wholesale brutality rare even among his pernicious race.<br><br>A vicious melee fighter in his own right, what makes him truly formidable is his favoured pet, the Giant Cave Squig Gobbla. The beast’s colossal teeth and voracious appetite make it a horrifying spectacle on the battlefield; to Gobbla, enemy units are as much a perambulating smorgasboard as a physical foe.     <br><br><strong>Unique start-position</strong><br>Skarsnik begins in Karak Azgaraz in the West Grey Mountains, having left Karak Eight Peaks to go Squig hunting. <br><br><strong>Campaign bonuses</strong><br>When chosen to lead a Grand Campaign, Skarsnik begins play with his vicious Giant Cave Squig Gobbla, who never leaves his side, and a Goblin Big Boss hero. Skarsnik also has unique skills which buff Goblin units, bring reduced upkeep costs for Goblin units, and his particularly sneaky nature means his Heroes’ actions cost less and garner greater experience gains.<br><br>Skarsnik can only recruit Orcs in Karak Eight Peaks however, which he must first recapture from mutinous elements of his tribe.<br><br><strong>Quests</strong><br>Skarsnik may embark upon a quest for his legendary weapon, Skarsnik’s Prodder. This vicious, halberd-style weapon is capable of unleashing an area-affect burst of powerful magic missiles.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>New Lords</strong></h2><br><strong>Runelord</strong><br>Dwarfen Runelords are among the most skilled practitioners of the Runic Arts. As they lead their armies into battle, they call upon the power of these runes to invigorate friendly units and hinder their foes. Runelords also have access to a new mount; at level 6, they may unlock and ride The Anvil of Doom into battle. This unique chariot empowers the Runelord’s runic abilities and increases his damage resistance.<br><br><strong>Night Goblin Warboss</strong><br>Spiteful, conniving and capricious, Night Goblin Warbosses can unlock unique skills which enhance the capabilities of Goblin, Night Goblin and Squig units, and imbue their entire army with poison attacks. At level 12, they can be mounted on Great Cave Squigs, providing the Warboss with greater damage resistance, speed and attack power.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>New units</strong></h2><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Crooked Moon</h2><strong>Squig herd</strong> <br>War beasts, Anti-infantry, Vanguard Deployment<br><br>Found in the caves deep beneath the World’s Edge Mountains, Squigs are improbable beasts. Part fungus and part flesh with spheroid bodies and a hopping gait, one might view them from a distance as comical. In close proximity however, they are anything but. As their beady eyes fasten on a target, they bound forward pell-mell, opening their gaping maws to reveal row upon row of dagger-like teeth. Prodded into battle by their Night Goblin herders, they make a swift and vicious anti-infantry force.<br><br><strong>Night Goblin Squig Hoppers</strong><br>Cavalry, anti-infantry, Vanguard Deployment, Poison Attacks<br>  <br>It takes a particularly unhinged individual to leap atop a Squig and ride it into battle. Fortunately, this is a defining characteristic of Night Goblins. Goaded onward by their squawking, cackling riders, such Squigs are driven at breakneck speed – swifter than their unsaddled counterparts – and consequently strike with renewed ferocity.<br><br><strong>Nasty Skulkers</strong><br>Sneaky infantry, Vanguard Deployment, Stalk, Armour Piercing<br><br>Nobody skulks like a Goblin, and the Nasty Skulkers are the very skulkiest. Armed with razor-sharp daggers, they sneak deep into the field before a battle and lie in wait. When the time is right, they leap out and strike, causing lethal armour piercing damage before scurrying away under a confounding cloud of smoke. It’s all too easy to dismiss the average goblin as a spineless wretch, but when a Nasty Skulker springs from nowhere to land on your shoulders, it’s enough to challenge your assumptions… should you survive the encounter.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Clan Angrund</h2>Rangers (upgradeable with Great Weapons)<br>Ranged/melee, fast, Vanguard Deployment, can Stalk<br><br>The long-range eyes and ears of a Dwarf Throng, Rangers are accustomed to operating alone, often deep in enemy territory.  Expert crossbowmen, they make superb ambushers – waiting patiently for the enemy to manoeuvre into their firing lines before letting fly with a cloud of thudding bolts. Should the enemy draw close, they are well-drilled melee combatants too, especially when armed with Great Weapons.<br><br><strong>Bugman’s Rangers</strong><br>Ranged/melee, fast, Vanguard Deployment, can Stalk Eternal vengeance-seekers for the destruction of their master’s fabled brewery, these veteran warriors often arrive unannounced before a battle to bear grim tidings, before joining the Throng for the fight ahead. They are peerless Rangers in their own right, though the unit never travels without the fortifying power of Bugman’s most potent brews. Such liquid fortification can transform their fighting abilities.<br><br><strong>Bolt Thrower</strong><br>Field artillery, armour-piercing<br><br>Tried and true, many clans still employ the Bolt Thrower, a war machine the Dwarfs have used since the days of the Ancestor Gods. Essentially oversized crossbows, they are accurate and reliable, hurling massive, razor-sharp bolts capable of piercing even the toughest armour.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>New Unique building Chain</strong></h2><br>The settlement of Karak Eight Peaks offers a unique Karak Eight Peaks building chain, the benefits of which differ depending on whether it is captured by Clan Angrund or The Crooked Moon Tribe.<br><br>If built by Clan Angrund, the benefits are as follows:<br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>    Level 1 focuses on making Karak Eight Peaks more defensible, giving unit stat bonuses when under siege.<br></li><li>    Level 2 focuses on rebuilding the Karak, giving large public order bonuses, unit experience for various units and reductions in corruption.<br></li><li>    Level 3 marks the recovery of the Ancestor Tombs, and supplies Ancestor Weapons for military units in nearby provinces, imbuing them with magical attacks.

They can be unlocked for recruitment when the Lord under your command has attained the sufficient skill level, and are instantly recruited from the special Regiments of Renown recruitment menu into his army. In this respect they differ from standard units, which spend at least one turn in the recruitment queue. <br><br>Alongside enhanced stats and top-tier (level 9) veterancy, each Regiment of Renown also has one or more special abilities its standard-roster counterpart does not.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Dwarfs</strong></h2><br><strong>Ulthuar’s Rangers (Rangers w/Great Weapons)</strong><br>Decreases enemy missile deflection and resistance<br><br><strong>Peak Gate Guard (Hammerers)</strong><br>Magic attacks, Immune To Psychology, Sunder Armour<br><br><strong>Gob-Lobber (Grudge Thrower)</strong><br>Enhanced Morale, reduces target Morale on impact, screaming Goblin ammo<br><br><strong>Skyhammer (Gyrobomber)</strong><br>multiple bombs per drop<br><br><strong>Ekrund Miners (Miners w/Blasting Charges)</strong><br>Frenzy, increased Blasting Charge ammo<br><br><strong>Warriors of Dragonfire Pass (Dwarf Warriors)</strong><br>Anti-infantry, Flaming Attacks<br><br><strong>The Skolder Guard (Irondrakes)</strong><br>Armour Piercing projectiles, Physical Resistance<br><br><strong>Norgrimling’s Ironbreakers (Ironbreakers)</strong><br>Vanguard Deployment, Immune To Psychology, increased unit size<br><br><strong>Dragonback Slayers (Slayers)</strong><br>Charge Defence, Physical Resistance, Fire Resistance, reduces targets speed, increases target flammability <br><br><strong>The Old Grumblers (Longbeards w/Great Weapons)</strong><br>AOE ally Fatigue augment<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Greenskins</strong></h2><br><strong>Da Rusty Arrers (Night Goblin Archers)</strong> <br>Armour sundering ranged attacks, Poison melee attacks<br><br><strong>Moon-Howlers (Goblin Wolf Riders)</strong><br>Fear<br><br><strong>Deff Creepers (Goblin Spider Riders)</strong> <br>Regeneration, Stalk<br><br><strong>Teef Robbers (Goblin Wolf Chariot)</strong><br>Vanguard Deployment, Hide In Forest<br><br><strong>Morgrub’s Mangy Marauders (Goblin Wolf Archers)</strong><br>Immune to psychology, Armour-piercing projectiles<br><br><strong>Hammer Of Gork (Goblin Rock Lobber)</strong><br>Debuff to target’s Missile Accuracy Melee Defence and Melee Attack, Poison Attacks)<br><br><strong>Durkit’s Squigs (Night Goblin Squig Hoppers)</strong> <br>Missile Resistance<br><br><strong>Da Eight Peaks Loonies (Nigh Goblin Fanatics)</strong><br>Unbreakable, Dwarf-on-a-chain!<br><br><strong>Broken Tusks Mob (Orc Boar Boy Big ‘Uns)</strong> <br>Armoured, Encourage<br><br><strong>Krimson Killerz (Black Orcs)</strong> <br>Anti-Infantry, dual-wielding Great Weapons, AOE attacks<br><br><strong>Da Warlord’s Boyz (Night Goblins)</strong><br>Immune To Psychology, Sunder Armour<br><br><strong>Venom Arachnarok Queen (Arachnarok Spider)</strong> <br>Can summon spider hatchlings unit to battle"

The creak and groan of living wood echoes from its dim interior, the canopy seems to absorb all light, and half-seen spirits dart between the twilit bowers. To enter is to place your fate in their hands.<br><br>Within dwell the Asrai, the Wood Elves. Though they hail originally from Ulthuan to the west as all Elves do, they spurn the sanctimonious arrogance of the Asur, the High Elves, and the murderous decadence of the Druchii or Dark Elves. The Asrai consider themselves to be the only true Elves left in the world, as they embrace all aspects of their nature – both light and dark – and for thousands of years, they have lived in harmony with the sentient forest.<br><br>The Asrai share the wilds of Athel Loren with its spirits and protectors: the Dryads, Branchwraiths and the ancient guardian Treemen. They adopt its steeds, hawks and Great Eagles for their warhosts, and even rare Forest Dragons may deign to join them when the need is dire. Peerless archers and riders, the Wood Elves pay fealty to the demigod Orion, who dies in flame each midwinter, only to be reborn into thunderous life in spring beneath The Oak of Ages.<br><br>Wild, lithe, and utterly ruthless in defence of their land, only a fool would goad the Wood Elves and their spirited allies to conflict. For those who witness the awesome spectacle of an Asrai host marching out of the woodlands on a Wild Hunt, it is likely the last thing they will ever see.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Campaign playstyle</h2><br>The Wood Elves campaign offers a uniquely different campaign experience to the other playable races of Total War: WARHAMMER. Their major infrastructure is housed in the Wood Elf settlements of Athel Loren, though they are capable of expanding outwards, capturing settlements and building limited outposts, known as Asrai Lookouts, in their stead. The heart of the campaign is The Great Oak, a unique 5-tier building related to the new Wonder victory condition.<br><br>In battle, the Wood Elves are swift and deadly, fielding many ‘glass cannon’ style units. While less physically robust than most other races, and with smaller unit sizes, they make up for this with excellent melee and ranged capabilities. They field some of the best archers in the game, many of whom can move and fire, and may later be upgraded with a range of specialised ammunition. They are often accompanied in battle by the woodland kin of Athel Loren, such as Dryads, Eagles and Treemen. Their spellcasters wield the Lores of Life, Beasts and Shadows.<br><br>New Story Campaign: The Season of Revelation<br>Set across a beautiful and highly-detailed campaign map of Athel Loren and the surrounding Duchies of Breton, The Season of Revelation is playable as either Durthu or Orion, the Wood Elves’ two Legendary Lords. This campaign tasks the player with uniting Athel Loren in the face of Bretonnian incursions and, later, from a series of fearsome, climactic attacks by the Beastman warlord Morghur, and his corrupted bray-herds.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Oak of Ages</h2><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/534331/extras/GIF2.jpg?t=1521822876"" ><br><br>The vast, ancient bowers of The Oak of Ages mark the spiritual heart of Athel Loren and the source of its sacred power.<br><br>In the Grand Campaign, The Oak of Ages is a unique 5-tier Wonder building sited in Athel Loren which the player must grow over the course of the campaign. As the Wood Elf player advances it to each new tier, they will receive increasing bonuses to their campaign.<br><br>Growing The Oak to tier 5 initiates The Battle of The Great Oak, a climactic multi-stage assault on Athel Loren’s spiritual centre by the combined and massed hordes of the Beastmen and Chaos Warriors. Victory (or survival!) marks the completion of the Wood Elves’ key campaign objective. <br><br>New additional currency: Amber<br>Alongside Gold, the Wood Elves require Amber to recruit certain elite units, to unlock certain technologies, and to expand the Oak of Ages. This is a finite resource in the world however, and can only be gained by capturing settlements and setting up Asrai Lookouts. <br><br>As Amber is limited, this presents the player with a constant choice over whether it should be spent on faction development, military might or achieving their key victory condition.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Wood Elf Settlements and Outposts</h2><br>The Wood Elves are capable of capturing any province in The Old World, regardless of its race origin. However, these settlement locations can only ever house Asrai Lookouts with very limited building options, turning them into army replenishment stops, recruitment stations (with access to the global recruitment pool but at local recruitment pricing), or as centres to exploit any regional trade resources. Major building chains will need to be built in the regions of Athel Loren itself, the only true home of the Wood Elves. Settlements in Athel Loren have 10 building slots, providing space to explore the Wood Elves’ extensive building trees.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Wood Elves infrastructure</h2><br>The Wood Elves have unique tech trees and buildings, and as a highly developed and somewhat aristocratic race, the Wood Elf Council presides over matters social and military. <br><br>This Council has a number of Offices to which characters may be appointed, and is subtly connected to the Wood Elves’ infrastructure. Certain buildings unlock Offices for example: if the Wild Heath building is unlocked in the tech tree, it can be built in a settlement, thereby unlocking the Herald Of The Hunt office. If one of the player’s Lords is appointed to this role, he will periodically call a Wild Hunt. This gives the Herald and his army a series of very significant bonuses for the turns in which the Wild Hunt event is active, heightening their marshal prowess and encouraging aggressive actions. Players are advised to explore these interconnections in order to get the most out of their Wood Elf campaigns.<br><br>The two Wood Elves legendary Lords, Orion and Durthu, both have Offices to which only they can be appointed, providing them with further campaign bonuses.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">New Legendary Lords</h2><br>A Wood Elves Grand Campaign may be led by one of two Legendary Lords: the demigod Orion, The King in The Woods, or the ancient Treeman, Durthu. Each begins play in a different starting position, controlling a different Athel Loren faction, and bring their own suite of campaign bonuses.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Orion The King in The Woods</h2><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/534331/extras/GIF3.jpg?t=1521822876"" ><br><br>Orion is the immortal demigod-king of Athel Loren and the Wood Elves. When his realm is threatened, he is the first to take up arms and fight in its defence. Every Elf feels the lure of their king’s wild summons, and many are overcome by their primal urges, abandoning civilised concerns and for the thrill of the hunt, and the heady tang of blood upon the wind. <br><br>Orion is a powerful melee warrior who also can deal sizeable ranged damage with his long-range spear attacks. He also has two unique area-effect abilities: Hounds of Orion, a magical vortex, and Hawk’s Talon, a magical bombardment. These attacks are bound to Orion and do not consume Winds of Magic.<br><br>Orion has two combat skill trees, two battle skill trees, and a campaign skill tree. This great range of skills, many of which are unique, allows him to specialise as he levels up. In particular, he can bring numerous improvements to the many bow units in the Wood Elves roster. When recruiting forces, Orion must pay an extra cost in Amber to hire woodland spirit units.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Durthu</h2><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/534331/extras/GIF4.jpg?t=1521822876"" ><br><br>Most ancient of the might Treemen of Athel Loren, Durthu was once a benevolent creature who found joy in the weave of forest life. It was he who first bound the spirits of the woodlands to the fate of the Asrai. And for a time, things existed in balance and harmony.<br><br>After many bloody incursions into Athel Loren however, with countless tress felled by outsiders for fuel, or merely out of spite, Durthu has become embittered. Worse still, he believes the Wood Elves themselves invited many of these calamities. Now, he does not consider them friends: merely allies in a common cause. <br><br>In the grand Campaign, Durthu leads the woodland spirits of the region of Argwylon in Athel Loren.  When recruiting forces, he must pay an extra cost in Amber to hire Wood Elf units. A powerful warrior and spellcaster, Durthu also wields the Lore of Beasts, and may summon Manticores into the thick of battle using The Transformation of Kadon.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">New Lords</h2><br>Wood Elves armies may recruit two new types of Lord to command their armies: Glade lords and Treemen.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Glade Lords</h2><br>The Highborn lords and ladies of Athel Loren have ruled the Wood Elves for millennia, and when the race goes to war, it is these nobles that direct their forces. Powerful warriors and excellent archers, they have two personal combat skill trees, each of which brings improvements to their archery and melee abilities. Likewise, their Battle trees augment their armies along two different paths – mell and ranged. They may also unlock three mount options as they level up: the Elven Steed, Great Eagle, and Forest Dragon.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Ancient Treemen</h2><br>Ancient Treemen are colossal in stature. Revered by Elf and forest-creature alike, their strength rivals that of even the dragons of the deep glades. The true guardians of the forest, these mighty woodland spirits are Spellcaster lords who wield the Lore of Beasts. While they have no mount options (there are few creatures in the world big enough to accommodate them), they have unique skills which grant increasing protection to all Tree Kin units in their armies.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Heroes</h2><br>Wood Elves armies may recruit three new types of Hero units to support their armies and perform Campaign Map actions. Each offers strong specialisation paths via their skill trees.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Spellsingers (Mage focus)</h2><br>Wood Elf mages have a unique relationship with Athel Loren. Connected to the deeper intelligence of the forest, they are highly attuned beings, sharing a bond with their surroundings in much the same way the Dryads, sprites and Treemen do. Spellsingers may be recruited to wield the Lores of Life, Shadow and Beasts.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Branchwraiths (Melee/Mage focus)</h2><br>Eldest of the Dryads, Branchwraith serve as handmaidens to the ancients of Athel Loren. Before the coming of the Elves, it was they who ruled the forest and tamed the Winds of Magic to bring sustenance to the wild woodlands. There is no love lost between Branchwraiths and the Asrai, though the uneasy peace continues, and these skilled practitioners of The Lore of Life can be found in many Wood Elf warhosts, casting spells in the thick of battle one minute, striking down foes with their powerful limbs the next.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Waystalkers (Spy, Ranged focus)</h2><br>The most skilled marksmen of the Waywatchers, Waystalkers are obsessed with The Hunt. Taciturn, solitary individuals, they show a dedication to their path that puts them in closer touch with the forest than their Elven kin. Expert snipers, they can move – and even remain hidden – while firing, singling out targets for the kill with a ruthless precision that no other archer can match.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Unit roster</h2><br>The Wood Elves roster contains many skilled archer units. When certain structures have been built, Glade Guard, Deepwood Scouts and Glade Riders may be recruited to fire three specialised ammunition types:<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Starfire shafts (Fire damage)<br></li><li>Hagbane Tips (Poison damage)<br></li><li>Swift Silver Shards (Magical damage)</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Melee Infantry</h2>Eternal Guard<br><br>Eternal Guard (shields)<br>Wardancers<br>Wardancers (Asrai spears)<br>Wildwood Rangers<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Ranged infantry</h2>Glade Guard<br><br>Glade Guard (Starfire Shafts)<br>Glade Guard (Hagbane Tips)<br>Deepwood Scouts<br>Deepwood Scouts (Swift Shiver Shafts)<br>Waywatchers<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Melee Cavalry</h2>Wild Riders<br><br>Wild Riders (shields)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Ranged cavalry </h2>Glade Riders<br><br>Glade Riders (Hagbane Tips)<br>Hawk Riders (flying)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Magical cavalry</h2>Sisters of The Thorn (may cast bound spells)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Woodland Spirit units</h2>Dryads<br>Treekin<br>Treeman<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Monstrous Units</h2>Great Eagle (flying)<br>Forest Dragon (flying)"

It is a lifeless realm of endless dunes, stained red from the blood of savages and barbarians. This is the Land of the Dead, where mummified kings are cursed to rule in perpetual unlife. But it was not always thus.<br><br>There was a time when the ancient kingdom of Nehekhara stood as a crown of human civilisation; a golden age when its cities shone with majestic splendour, its armies conquered entire nations and its kings ruled as gods among men. But this realm was razed millennia ago by the treacherous sorcery of reviled Nagash: in a stroke, the living perished and the dead rose from their tombs.<br><br>Death is no barrier to glory for the Tomb Kings however. In unlife, they will see the empire of Nehekhara restored to greatness! <br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/617870/extras/GIF2.jpg?t=1522072963"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Campaign gameplay</strong></h2><br><br><strong>Objectives </strong><br>While Tomb Kings can be played in the Eye of the Vortex campaign, they do not seek to influence the vortex, and therefore do not engage in the race for control of it. Instead, they seek the nine cursed Books of Nagash, a search culminating in an epic battle at the Black Pyramid of Nagash itself. Each of these books grants a unique campaign bonus, and puts the player a step further along the road to victory.<br><br><strong>Unique resource: Canopic Jars</strong><br>Ancient containers filled with arcane energy, Canopic Jars can be collected through missions, buildings, and as post-battle loot. They are used to awaken powerful units, unlock techs, perform rites and to craft unique items in the Mortuary Cult. <br><br><strong>The Mortuary Cult</strong><br>Keepers of the Lore of Nehekhara and the secrets of revivification, the Liche Priests of the Mortuary Cult can be called upon to construct unique and venerable items. Using a combination of trade resources and Canopic Jars, the player can order the construction of unique magic weapons, armour, talismans, plus enchanted and arcane items. For a cost, the Mortuary Cult can also resurrect powerful Legions of Legend for use in your armies. <br><br><strong>The Dynasties of Nehekhara</strong><br>Rather than developing new technologies, the Tomb Kings seek to unearth the achievements of their dynastic forbears. By studying these histories, players can resurrect great rulers of the past to serve as Lords for their armies, increase capacity for the various Tomb Kings Heroes, unlock a host of campaign and unit buffs, and awaken the Heralds of ancient armies – unique followers who bring powerful bonuses to key unit types in an army. <br><br><br><strong>Rites</strong><br>The Tomb Kings have four unique Rites which may be unlocked and used in campaign:<br><br><strong>Great Incantation of Ptra</strong><br>Invoking the sun god summons Ptra’s Necrotect, a unique Hero character capable of colonising ruins at city level 3.<br><br><strong>Great Incantation of Khsar</strong><br>Invoking the god of the desert wind generates sandstorms across all player-owned regions. This causes attrition to foreign armies, increases your ambush success chance and confers the army ability Sand Veil (enables a unit to become Hidden and gain Stalk in battle, making them invisible to the enemy until they draw very close).<br><br><strong>Great Incantation of Geheb</strong><br>Invoking the god of strength increases Canopic Jar generation and province growth, reduces construction time, and confers the army ability Tombswarm (a swirling swarm of Scarabs which damages the target and moves in the same manner as a vortex spell).<br><br><strong>Great Incantation of Tahoth</strong><br>Invoking the god of scholars adds a Casket of Souls magical artillery unit to the recruitment pool. It also confers a rank bonus to newly recruited Tomb Kings and unit recruits, and increases recruitment capacity factionwide.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Legendary Lords</strong></h2><br><br>The Tomb Kings feature four playable Legendary Lords, each with their own abilities, campaign bonuses, skill trees, quest-chains and campaign start-positions in both the Eye of the Vortex campaign and Mortal Empires.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/617870/extras/GIF3.jpg?t=1522072963"" ><br><br><strong>Settra The Imperishable</strong><br>Settra is the king of all Tomb Kings. He is a ruthless leader whose thirst for conquest knows no bounds. Unlike other Tomb Kings, his unyielding will is such that he never needs to return to his sarcophagus to rest. The immortality he so desired in life is now his, and the civilisations that flourished in his absence now feel his wrath. <br><br>Settra is a great leader, bringing bonuses to growth and public order, while reducing construction time. He also confers bonus armour to Skeleton Chariot and Tomb Guard units, and has a selection of unlockable mounts, including the Khemrian Warsphinx and the flame-wreathed Chariot of the Gods.<br><br><br><strong>High Queen Khalida</strong><br>The Warrior-Queen of Lybaras was famed for her intelligence, honour and bravery. Her reign was cut tragically short by her cousin Neferata, who had attempted to create the Elixir of Life. Instead of true immortality though, Neferata’s flawed potion granted the twisted form known as Vampirism, and as the first Vampire slew her cousin in combat, she granted her the Blood Kiss. With her last breath, Khalida cried out to Asaph, the serpent goddess, who purified her of the taint. She is now the Goddess’ chosen, with Asaph’s divine venom coursing through her veins.<br><br>Khalida reduces all forms of corruption, enjoys a diplomatic relations bonus with other Tomb Kings factions and grants a hefty bonus to ammunition for all ranged units across her faction. She also confers poison attacks on all units in her army and suffers considerably less from attrition effects. <br><br><br><strong>Grand Hierophant Khatep</strong><br>The head of the Mortuary Cult’s Hieorphantic Council, Khatep is the oldest and wisest of the Liche Priests, and the first of them to deny death’s embrace. It was Khatep who awoke Settra to unlife after Nagash’s Great Ritual levelled Nehekhara, but Settra’s distrust of the Mortuary Cult led him to exile Khatep. Now he roams the Land of the Dead, assisting the Tomb Kings where he can and seeking a way to restore himself in the eyes of Settra.<br><br>Khatep grants a bonus to Dynasty research rate, and improves casualty replenishment and army movement factionwide. He can also recruit a higher number of Liche Priest Heroes, and recruits them at a higher rank. <br><br><br><strong>Arkhan the Black</strong><br>Nagash’s principle lieutenant, Arkhan helped lead the coup which brought the hated arch-necromancer to initial power. He led many armies against Nagash’s enemies, and was finally slain in a suicidal counter-attack against the Priest King’s soldiers that enabled Nagash to escape. He was raised again by his master to become the Liche King, and for countless generations since Nagash’s death at the hands of King Alcadizaar, he has vented his wrath on the lands of the living.   <br><br>Arkhan enjoys bonus diplomatic relations with Vampire Counts factions, and his regions never suffer public order penalties from Vampiric corruption. Heroes embedded in his army gain melee attack and melee defence bonuses, and all his armies factionwide gain a boost to their Winds of Magic Power Reserve. <br><br><br><strong>New Lord: Tomb King</strong><br>Tomb Kings are the principle Lords which lead the armies of Nehekhara. A number will appear as standard in the recruitment pool, but unique, named Tomb Kings – famous rulers from the six dynasties of Nehekharan history – may be resurrected via the Dynasties panel, at which point they enter your Lords recruitment pool. Tomb kings may unlock the Skeletal Steed, Skeleton Chariot, and Khemrian Warsphinx as mounts.<br><br><strong>New Hero: Tomb Prince</strong><br>Following the example of their kings, Tomb Princes aspire to greatness in all things. They form the principle champions of the Nehekharan forces in battle, and have a unique Curse ability which makes targeted enemies enter a state of Rampage. Tomb princes may unlock Skeletal Steeds and Skeletal Chariots as mounts.<br><br><strong>New Hero: Liche Priest</strong><br>The adepts of the Mortuary Cult are the Tomb King’s principle sorcerers. They may be recruited to wield the Lore of Light, the Lore of Death, or the Lore of Nehekhara, and have a unique Curse ability which reduces enemy armour values. They also gain the Immortal skill earlier than other agents. Liche priests may unlock Skeletal Steeds and Skeleton Chariots as mounts.<br><br><strong>New Hero: Necrotect</strong><br>Representing millennia of architectural wisdom, Necrotects are the builders and taskmasters of Nehekhara. They perform a number of functions, such as reducing building costs and increasing movement speed when embedded in your armies, but also fulfil a key support role in battle. As master masons, they provide passive aura-based buffs to Construct units such as Ushabti, Tomb Scorpions and Hierotitans, improving their combat abilities in a number of ways. Necrotects may unlock Skeletal Steeds and Skeleton Chariots as mounts.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Battle gameplay</strong></h2><br><br><strong>The Realm of Souls </strong><br>The Realm of Souls is the revered afterlife of Nehekharan legend, and the origin of the Liche Priests’ magical power. As more of your warriors fall to the enemy in battle, more souls enter the Realm, which is tracked in the battle UI. At three key thresholds, the Realm of Souls triggers a mass healing-wave among your skeletal units, each wave becoming successively more powerful. After the final wave, the player also gains an army ability allowing them to summon a unit of statuesque Ushabti anywhere on the battlefield.  <br><br><strong>The Lore of Nehekhara</strong><br>In battle, Liche Priests may harness the power of the desert gods and wield the Tomb King’s signature magic, the Lore of Nehekhara."

New customers can get almost double the content that was included in the original Standard Edition, at 75% off the regular pricing.<br><br>Existing customers can also expand their collection with 75% off the items they don't already own.

Sure there are hundreds of locos and dozens of routes and sessions you can drive in the Platinum Edition Bundle.

There are now well over 10,000 routes available on the Trainz Download Station (DLS) that you can download for free and enjoy.

Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted &quot;on-the-fly&quot;. By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car).<br><br>If physics aren't your thing, don't worry.

The game features the most accurately created map, complex morale, innovative control mechanics and smart AI. You have the freedom to use different strategies while the battle progresses. Your decisions and military performance play a crucial role in the result. Lead your army and win the Battle of Gettysburg! <br><br>It has been voted as Best Strategy Game of 2014 by PCGamesN.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/306660/extras/UGG_Big_Battle_4_sharpen.jpg?t=1478101292"" ><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Main Features </h2><br><strong>Smart AI Commanders</strong> <br>Ultimate General: Gettysburg does not use “AI gameplay cheats” because it does not need them. The game’s difficulty is accomplished only by nine distinctive AI personalities, each with their own advantages and special skills. AI Commanders are able to evaluate and gain tactical superiority in real time, reacting according to their different commanding skills, aggressively or defensively, heroically or cunningly and resemble different, competent human players. <br><br>Each one of the AI generals is a formidable, non-scripted opponent who can actively try to flank you, secure strategic locations with artillery, keep reserves and reinforce areas that it attacks or defends. The AI will try to win the battle with tactics that fit to its personality. For example a defensive opponent may not attack ferociously in the first engagement and progressively advance its forces in the next battles.<br><br><i><u>What players say</u>: “Fantastic AI - don't know what kind of brain you put in this game but it works”</i><br><br><strong>Multi-Day Dynamic Battle</strong> <br>On the morning of July 1st 1863, the two armies meet near Gettysburg. Reinforcements arrive from historically accurate directions as the battle progresses, however, random events, delays and tactical differences are always a possibility that can change the results of each engagement compared to history.<br><br>Can you re-enact Pickett’s Charge? What if Lee attacked the center of the Union Army early in the morning of July 2nd of 1863 instead of attempting to flank the extreme left in the afternoon? What would happen if Meade counter-attacked on July 4th 1863? These questions and more can be answered within the game engine of Ultimate General: Gettysburg.<br><br>The battle is dynamically fought in time phases and can last up to 4 days. Each day can be separated by up to 3 time phases and the armies’ condition and positioning on the map are saved.<br><br>According to battle events, you have the possibility to take decisions that can change the tide of the battle based on your prior tactical prowess. For example, when leading the Confederates, on the morning of July 2nd, you can choose to attack at Cemetery Hill and not make a delayed flanking maneuver at Peach Orchard… if you have managed to take Seminary Ridge the previous day! You can even choose to defend and wait for your AI opponent to take the initiative between days. These choices greatly increase the number of possible battle outcomes and challenges.<br><br><i><u>What players say</u>:“9 different AI profiles, multiple outcomes, multiple strategies, casualties carry over. This game is a different experience every time. Well worth it, can't wait for the next one.”</i><br><br><strong>Easy Controls &amp; Unit Self-Awareness</strong> <br>Drag simple movement arrows to command large forces easily. Units do not need your micromanagement because they are able to act on their own initiative and re-align, switch targets, withdraw and form battle lines without player input. Consequently, you are able to give generic commands to your units and can rely on them to fight efficiently without the need for “babysitting”. <br><br><i><u>What players say</u>: “Innovative movement system - this is by far an awesome system they developed. It’s not only insanely easy to learn, but also incredibly innovative”</i><br><br><strong>Detailed Map of Gettysburg</strong> <br>Utilizing satellite images and historical maps, every major location, house, ridge and hill are depicted as accurately as possible within the game’s unique art style. If you are an American Civil War enthusiast, you will be especially happy to notice the amount of precision and information that the map provides. Not only will you be able to better understand the historical layout of the map, you will also be able to make use of each location and landmark in battle, thanks to the simulation of cover, concealment, terrain and high ground in the game. <br><br><i><u>What players say</u>: “Incredible Gorgeous Map - I had to capitalize that because this map is by far one of the best maps of Gettysburg I have ever seen either in a game or even in books”</i><br><br><strong>Advanced Line of Sight</strong><br>Elevation and obstructions affect unit visibility realistically. Units may make use of concealment and cover to survive artillery barrages, stage ambushes and more, but beware – the AI will attempt to do the same to you. The units enter or exit the Fog of War gradually with a fade in/out effect that helps you perceive their hiding and course seamlessly. <br><br><i><u>What players say</u>: “The way Game Labs implemented Line of Sight in this game should be held as an example to other developers to do the same”</i><br><br><strong>Numerous Tactical Factors</strong> <br>In Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you will realize that army units are not “machines” that blindly follow orders, but they need to conserve strength and courage for decisive battle actions. Every basic tactical element that is expected for a strategy game is incorporated into gameplay. Most importantly, morale is affected by many factors including flank or rear attacks, casualties, volley shocks, artillery fire and fatigue. <br><br><i><u>What players say</u>: “... positioning of units matters. You really bring the struggles of 19th century warfare to life here”</i><br><br><strong>Historically Accurate Forces and Leaders</strong> <br>Ultimate General: Gettysburg includes the full order of battle for the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Unit sizes range from the small artillery batteries to vast infantry brigades with cavalry and skirmishers in between.<br>All brigades have troop numbers and differing competencies based on historical facts. Additionally, all artillery battery numbers and types are correctly simulated. Lastly, major generals and officers actively participate in the battlefield to organize and support the armies and appear in after action battle reports to help you monitor battle progress. <br><br><i><u>What players say</u>: “Immersive American Civil War feel: sounds, portraits and general historical authentic really make this one of the most immersive historical games I have played, and I am a total history buff”</i><br><br>Furthermore, every inch of the map has a strategic role. Sloping, terrain type and obstructions affect unit movement realistically. Elevations, ridges and hills provide excellent firing positions and give increased sight, morale and accuracy to troops stationed there.<br>By placing your units close to each other, they become more resilient to charges and flank attacks but get more vulnerable to projectile fire. Thus, forcing your enemy to keep his lines dense while you shell him with artillery can be a valid tactic. As the condition of your units changes dynamically during the battle, the effectiveness of your whole army is affected. For example, units fire more coordinated volleys when they have high morale and have more discipline and tight formations.<br><br>These and many more deep gameplay mechanics are packed into a simple and intuitive GUI that aims to ease the game experience for the player without overwhelming with complex statistics.<br><br><strong>Evolving Multiplayer Experience</strong><br>The game currently offers 18 maps for 1vs1 matches and is continuously improved according to user feedback. <br><br><i><u>What players say</u>: “Well, actually, the AI in this game is about the best ever seen (except for chess), and there is a working multiplayer with about always at least one battle going.”</i><br><br><strong>Ultimate General: Gettysburg</strong> is developed by Game Labs and designed by Nick Thomadis, known for his successful and popular “DarthMod” series.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">How to Play</h2><a href=""http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/306660/manuals/Field_Manual.pdf?t=1413383900"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  > Please read our guide</a></a>"

Soon Ubersreik is a charnel-town, drowning beneath the malevolent shadow of the Horned Rat. <br><br>Yet even in the darkest times, there are always champions to light the way. As Ubersreik cowers, five heroes, united by capricious fate, carry the fight to the rat-men. It remains to be seen whether they have the strength to survive, let alone work together long enough to thwart the invaders. One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them. </i>"

From the ashes of old America, a new world emerges, and an ersatz, post-apocalyptic, stillborn 80’s continues indefinitely, populated entirely by the toughest, meanest, and outright dumbest of God’s creations, the Wasters.<br><br>Live the life of a Waster, fighting tooth and nail, bullets and baseball bats over the most precious of unnatural resources, a liquid from beneath the sands that fuels all of un-civilization: Booze.

Deliverance is poised upon three Dwarven astronauts who are sent on an expedition to find a new star in the depths of the Endless Stone. Take control of Forcer, Smashfist, and Shadow as they explore the unknown territories of the stone universe while meeting new civilizations and ancient monsters from the deep layers of space.<br />
<br />
We Are The Dwarves is an action-based tactical adventure with active pause (extreme slowdown of time) placing you in control of three Dwarven astronauts. Forcer is capable of ranged destruction, and timely set-up exectution. Smashfist, a brute at heart, gets up close and personal with rage worth avoiding. Shadow stays just where you'd expect him to, launching deadly successive assassinations and precision archery from afar. As a trio, combine each dwarfs attack styles into orchestrated destruction against your foe.<br />
<br />
Features of We Are The Dwarves -<br />
Three distinct characters, each with an array of abilities and talents.<br />
Individual skill trees for each dwarf; customization varies from stealth to slasher​.<br />
Pause and queue gameplay - slow time and set up a series of commands to be executed.<br />

7856f8f5-0eb1-4f36-a411-d56198823c38,,"Gaming's notoriously naughty squirrel, Conker, arrives on Xbox with a bang in an all-new Xbox Live-enabled team-based shooter ""Conker: Live and Reloaded."" Featuring intense deathmatch and campaign storyline modes via Xbox Live and System Link, ""Conker"" allows players to compete as one of six combat specialists across multimission campaigns covering Old War and Future War. The warfare promises to deliver the nonstop action, humor, gratuitous violence and innuendo for which ""Conker"" is famous.<br><br>

Also included is the critically acclaimed single-player game ""Conker's Bad Fur Day®,"" completely recreated for Xbox with stunning graphics and unparalleled attitude.<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Team-focused, story-driven, Xbox Live gameplay. Team-based gameplay is the heart of this shooter, which pits the Noble Squirrels against the Evil Tediz. Players can choose from a variety of scenario-based missions featuring two distinct and unique campaigns — Old War and Future War. Each mission features its own distinctly challenging gameplay mode. Campaign storylines, composed of multiple missions played progressively, bring an innovative and fresh approach to team-based shooters and support up to 16 players on Xbox Live.</li>


<li>Elite squad formation. Players can choose from six character classes, Skyjockey, Long Ranger, Grunt, Demolisher, Thermophile and Sneeker, each with signature weapons and abilities. In ""Conker: Live and Reloaded,"" the composition of a team gives it strategic and tactical advantages and implications. </li>
<li>Xbox Live. Team-based gameplay, innovative campaign storylines and distinctive humor all make for a great experience on Xbox Live. Online players strategize, cooperate and communicate as a team in campaign mode, or venture out solo against buddies in deathmatch. Players can earn medals, rise through the ranks, secure unlockables and download new maps.</li>


<li>Massive arsenal for maximum carnage. Devastating weapons include camera-guided rockets, an acid thrower and loads of grenade types. Players can operate five types of vehicles — Sky Steed, Mule Bomber, R-Hog, Toad Jeep and Tankus — and equipment such as anti-infantry sentries, medi-guns and a snoop camera. Players have special abilities that allow them to disguise themselves or feign death and sneak up on unsuspecting foes to unload a demoralizing array of attacks.</li>


<li>Raunchy, twisted and irreverent world of ""Conker."" Over-the-top humor, characters and gameplay dominate in every way with rude wit, lewd innuendoes and ridiculously graphic violence.

After 4 years of waiting, the sequel to the surreal first-person brawler brings more variety in combat and levels, and even more bizarre storytelling into the beguiling world of Zenozoik.  Join forces with your former foe Rimat and battle against scores of angry denizens, preventing their dastardly machinations from being realized. <br />
<br />
Zeno Clash 2 welcomes new players to the Zeno Clash universe with a new game that will bring them into the universe and fill them in on the backstory. Returning players will delight in the connections between the new settings and the first adventure. All players will thoroughly enjoy playing a first-person brawler that provides a rarity in modern gaming: a truly unique experience.<br />
<br />
Zeno Clash 2 has beefed up its combat engine with precision punch targeting, blocking, and high-impact hits that only make the bone-crunching, face-rattling fistcuffs more satisfying. The new &quot;Lock-on&quot; function gives players a wider range of control for dishing out the damage. New RPG mechanics will allow Ghat and Rimat to punch harder, defend better, and recruit more powerful allies to aid in their quest. Zeno Clash 2 now harnesses the full power of the Unreal III engine to bring the bizarre and beautiful world of Zenozoik to life. ACE Team's boundless imagination brings gamers into a universe of surreal foes, fantastic locations, and truly unique visuals that is unlike anything else you will ever play. With the newly added drop-in/drop-out co-op play, Zeno Clash 2 invites you AND a friend to dive once more into the fray!"

Badass bosses! Carrots! Ziggurat is the best combination of First Person Shooter and Rogue-LITE you have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Become a neophyte sorcerer, and get ready for your rite of passage: Enter the labyrinth and face dangerous challenges to prove your worth and become a powerful wizard! <br />
<br />
The game focuses on fast-paced first person shooting, with an old-school vibe, and updated handling and game mechanics. Dungeon crawling and RPG/Roguelike elements are added into the mix, resulting in a fun, challenging and varied game, with lots of content to discover.<br />
<br />
Fight almighty bosses, get through rooms filled with traps, and treasures that may help you in your journey... Each game is a whole new experience! <br />
<br />
Unlike most Rogue-thingies, on Ziggurat your combat skills will be the most important asset to keep advancing. Leveling up and randomly generated content is there to improve variety and make each game different, not to make the game a roll dice or an unbearable grind.<br />
<br />
Most perks are designed to change the way you have to play or the weapons you'll want to use. Do you want more speed in exchange for less health, or maybe is better to have mana regeneration? Increase drop rate, or refill ammo here and now? No number game here, simple and direct choices.<br />
<br />
We've also ensured that, as a proper FPS game, the experience is quick and direct. There's no inventory to manage or the need to compare two almost equal item drops, just weapon selection, and mana/health are usually the bargaining chip.<br />
<br />
A whole arsenal of magic and alchemic weapons will be at your disposal. Wreak havoc among your enemies, but watch your mana reserves or you might regret it later!<br />
<br />
Magic staves, spellbooks, magic wands... dozens of weapons with different attack strategies that help keeping the game fresh!"
